<h2><a name=bookmark3>Chapter One</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='color:windowtext'>N</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>ew York, New York. A blissful spring
morning beckoned, cloudless and blue and pure. I was driving my high-mileage
Toyota down Seventh Avenue, headed for the location shoot that was supposed to
wind up principal photography for my first feature film, <i>Baby Love</i>. It
was about the pain and joy of adoption. I guess directing your first feature is
something like giving birth to your first child, but that gets us way, way
ahead of the story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My name, by the way, is Morgan Smyth James, after two
grandmothers, and I'm thirty-eight and single and strive to be eternally
optimistic. That morning, however, in spite of everything else, I was missing
Steve terribly and feeling like I'd screwed up essential components of my life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>To try for some perspective, let me say I'd always planned to
have a normal, loving family. Really. Find an emotionally present soul mate who
cared about things I care about—okay, slim and smart and spectacular in bed
wouldn't be a minus—get married on a lawn with lots of white roses some sunny June
afternoon, work one or even two perfect kids into our fulfilling, giving lives.
But somehow I'd managed to have none of that. I'd messed up at every turn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In reality I had nobody to blame but myself. Eighteen years
ago, just out of college, I turned down two really nice guys. My body was
fertile and hormone-driven—was it ever!—but grad school loomed and my greatest
fear (instead of, as now, my fondest hope) was getting &quot;trapped&quot; into
motherhood. Also, I had the youthful delusion that life was forever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was, in truth, one simpatico young director I met at
NYU film school whom I would have married in a minute, but after Jason won my
heart he dumped me for his under­graduate sweetheart who had skillfully gotten
herself knocked up during his Christmas break.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which was when I first developed my fallback strategy for
coping with bad news. After moping around in sweats for two days, cutting class
and hiding in a revival house showing a Goddard retrospective, not
understanding half the French and too bleary-eyed to read the subtitles, I
decided to build a defense system. From that day on, I'd put all heart­break in
a special box, nail down the lid, and act as though it wasn't there. It worked
then and it still works, more or less, now. People sometimes accuse me of
living in selective denial (they're right), but it makes me one heck of a
survivor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And something else. I decided then and there to focus my
life: I'd concentrate on learning to make movies and let the family part just
play out naturally. I had the idea that whereas men's affections couldn't be
controlled, a career could. Even then I realized it was only a partial truth,
but I decided to go with it anyway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which brings us down to three years back. And a funny thing
was happening. Almost without realizing it, I'd started lingering in stores to
look at little pink jumpers, begun gazing into the baby carriages that suddenly
seemed to be sprouting everywhere. The phrase &quot;my baby&quot; became the
most pow­erful one I could imagine, made my throat swell till I'd half choke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At which precise time, like a <i>deus ex machina</i>, enter
Steve Abrams, the man who gave me hope. He came along just as I was noticing
that infinite stream of wonderful guys had dwindled down to relationship
dropouts, men with distant eyes and former wives in other states. We discovered
each other at the reopened Oloffson Hotel in Haiti, where I was shooting a
documentary about voodoo and he was photo­graphing that country's ragged,
plucky children for National Geographic. No ex-spouses, no need for psychic
pampering. Okay, he wasn't going to win a Mr. Universe contest any time soon;
he had a couple of extra pounds that, actually, I kind of liked. But he was my
age, had great brown eyes, sandy hair thinning only just a bit. No Greek god
but definitely a man. He could tune a Jeep carburetor with his eyes closed or
fix a cranky hotel lock, then recite Byron (sort of) and proceed to snare the
perfect Chilean red for crawfish <i>etouffee</i> (yes!). But I knew I loved him
when I realized it was more than any of that. I felt as if I'd found the other
half of myself. Just one glance across the table and we each knew what the
other was thinking, feeling. We'd laugh at the same instant, then as though on
cue, half cry together over the miseries of that wretched island. Sometimes it
was almost eerie. And as for lovemaking, let me just say Steve didn't need a
how-to manual. We were made for each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe it's un-PC to mention it, but I also felt safe around
him. And I think he felt the same. We liked that feeling. Us fending off the
world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When we got back to New York, we had to see each other every
day. We still had separate apartments—thanks to the New York real-estate
squeeze—but we were scouting in our spare time for an affordable loft in lower
Manhattan that could accommodate Steve's darkroom, my office, and—yes—a baby.
We evolved into parents-to-be, pricing baby carriages. Who could have predicted
it? The joy of sharing a need. It was a total high.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before long we decided to stop waiting for the perfect</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>space. We'd
start on the baby anyway, our first joint pro­ject—which, we believed, would
only be the first of many.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But nothing happened. Over a year and still nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when life began to feel like a cruel
bait-and-switch. When you aren't ready, you can produce a baby in a momentary
absence-of-mind, whereas once you're finally an adult, accomplished,
lots-to-offer woman, ready to be the mother you wish you'd had, your body has
closed down your baby-making equipment like an unused Rust Belt factory.
Fertility has calculatingly abandoned you for the Sun Belt of youth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well,&quot; Dr. Hannah Klein, my long-time ob/gyn,
declared, &quot;our tests all indicate you're both fertile, so just keep
trying, under optimum conditions.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Optimum conditions. There followed almost a year of
&quot;optimum conditions.&quot; Do it upside down; wait and have a cold shower
while I take my temperature; no, not that way, not tonight. My mucus is
thicker: Quick! Eventually we both began feeling like laboratory rats. Our
once-incredible love life drifted into something only a boot-camp sergeant with
Nazi leanings could be turned on by.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I think that's what finally caused Steve to go over the edge.
Three months ago—a Friday morning I shall never forget—he stepped out of my
shower, swathed himself in a white towel, and announced he was going to Central
America to do a book. He needed time to think. The move, he ex­plained, wasn't
about us. He really wanted to spend a year down there with his Nikon, capturing
the region's tentative processes of democratic transition. Besides, he was
begin­ning to think we'd both gone a little mental about the baby.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Out came that special box of heartbreak again. I consoled
myself we were just having a seventh-inning stretch, but the wisdom in that box
told me I'd somehow blown it. The baby we hadn't created had become a specter
hovering in the ether between us, ever a reminder of failure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As a parting gesture, the never-say-die long shot, he left a
&quot;deposit&quot; with Dr. Klein—for her liquid-nitrogen
womb-in-waiting—enough for two final intrauterine inseminations. Later on today
I was going to see her and find out if our last and final attempt had stuck.
But nothing about my cycle was giving me any hope.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the meantime, though, I had a movie to finish. We were
shooting an interview at a five-story condominium building in Greenwich Village
belonging to a woman named Carly Grove, who'd recently adopted. Her story was
intriguing, but now—with my own hopes of ever having a baby down to two outs in
the bottom of the ninth—well, now I had more than one reason for wanting to
meet her. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I arrived, I lucked into a parking space right in front.
Our security guy, Lou Crenshaw, was off today getting some city paperwork
sorted out, but my crew was already upstairs—as director I get to arrive at a
decent hour, though later on I also get to do lonely postproduction work till
mid­night—leaving our three vans double-parked, with a New York City Film Board
permit prominently displayed inside each windshield. The building, formerly a
Hertz parking ga­rage, was near the end of Barrow Street, facing the Hudson
River, and was filled with artists and entrepreneurs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The truth was, I wanted to get the interview on film as soon
as possible. I was more than a little worried Carly might decide to get cold feet
and back out. She'd started to hedge when I had one last confirming chat with
her last night, something about a &quot;no-disclosure&quot; agreement she now
re­membered signing. This had to be a one-take, all-or-nothing shoot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which was why I'd sent down the full gang this morning, not
just the &quot;key&quot; personnel as I'd initially planned. Leading my
(motley) crew was the director of photography, first cam­eraman Roger Drexel, a
grizzled veteran with a ponytail who'd been with my producer, David Roth and
his Applecore Productions, from back when he did beach movies and splat­ter
films. He worked with the production manager, Erica Cole, our lipstick lesbian,
who coordinated crew schedules. The second camera was handled by Greer Seiber,
recently of NYU film school, who was so happy to have a job, any job, she acted
as though David's previous string of low-budget, B-flick epics were remakes of <i>Gone
With the Wind</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Scott Ventri, another Applecore old-timer, was key
grip, the guy who got the gear on and off the vans, set it up, and signed off
on safety regs. Today he also was responsible for blacking out windows and
setting up lights. The chief elec­trician, gaffer, was Ralph Cafiero, who'd
come down the pre­vious day and temporarily hot-wired the circuit breaker in
the apartment to make sure there was enough amperage. He and his lighting
&quot;crew,&quot; another bright-eyed (and cheap) NYU grad named Paul Nulty,
had arrived this morning ahead of everybody else to pre-light the
&quot;set,&quot; a northeast corner of the apartment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'm always a little hyper about sound, so I'd asked Tony
Wills, who handled recording, to also come down the pre­vious day and record
the &quot;tone&quot; of the living room, the sound when there is no sound, in
order to have it available for ed­iting. Today he'd run the boom mike and be
assisted by Sherry Moran, his latest girlfriend, who was mixer/recordist. For
Carly's makeup and hair, I had Arlene Morris, an old friend from all the way
back to my early days as an AD on the soaps. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I rang Carly's bell and she buzzed me right up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She doubtless had a closet full of Donna Karan suits, but she
came to the door in pre-faded jeans and a striped sweater.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>A successful
publicity agent, she was petite, with dark hair and eyes and an obvious
don't-bug-me take on life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come on in. My nanny's here to help keep Kevin out of
the way.&quot; She was sounding like she'd gotten her old spunk back, or so it
seemed at first. &quot;I've completely cleared the living room.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I looked around the place, now a vision of setup pandemonium.
&quot;You're sure this is all right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well . . .&quot; She was biting at her lip. &quot;Maybe
we ought to talk first, okay? But come on in. I'll probably do it. Maybe I just
need a good reason to. . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As her voice trailed off, I found myself mining my brain for
a sales point. Finally, out of the blue, I settled on one. &quot;Because you're
totally crazy?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She laughed out loud. &quot;Not a bad start. I live in total
madness. It's the definition of my life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I laughed too and looked around. No kidding. Her loft
apartment was a wild mixture of stairs and galleries and lev­els—unconventional
in every way. Also, it had a lot of in-your-face decor, outrageous posters, and
African fertility masks, signs of a wonderful, irreverent personality. Then
too, stuffed animals and toys were strewn all over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can't really afford the rent,&quot; she declared,
seeing me survey the place, &quot;but I need the space for Kevin. I've just
joined Bloomingdale's Anonymous. Twelve steps to shred­ding your charge
plates.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her nanny, a Jehovah's Witness from Jamaica named Marcy (who
reminded me of a cuddly voodoo doll, complete with cornrows), was bringing
Carly's little boy Kevin down from his bath in the upstairs bathroom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was definitely adopted, sandy-haired and peachy, noth­ing
like Carly's dark, severe strands and Mediterranean skin. When Marcy put him
down, he tried to walk, and I felt my envy ratchet upward a notch. He'd just
started taking tentative steps, at eleven months old, and there was still a
Frankenstein quality as he strode stiff-legged, arms out for balance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I walked over, picked him up, and gave him a kiss. He looked
like a Scandinavian travel poster, a cherubic vision, and I felt a great void
growing where my heart had been. Then Marcy reached out and pried him from me.
I hated to let him go so much I almost pulled him back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're so lucky,&quot; I said to Carly, feeling a surge
of yearn­ing. &quot;He's great.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know,&quot; she said, &quot;I've been thinking
about that 'no disclosure' thing Children of Light made me sign. That's their
name, by the way. Like a vow of silence about them. They seemed pretty serious
about it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dear God, I thought, don't let her chicken out. Don't, don't.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So, we won't mention them. Just never use their
name.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stood a minute, mute, and then her eyes grew determined.
&quot;No, I've got a better idea. I like you. And I think more single women
ought to know about adoption. So you know what? I think I'll use their name all
over the damned place. I paid what they asked, and for that I ought to be able
to do what I want. What are they going to do? Come and steal Kevin back?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she sighed and stared at me. &quot;Maybe, though, you
could run through again how exactly we fit into this movie.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I liked to tell the story to people, just to get their
reaction. There are always moments of doubt in the film-making pro­cess when
you wonder if the audience for your picture is going to consist entirely of
your immediate family, your backers, and your creditors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, as I tried to explain before, it's a fictional
construct intended to feel like a documentary, about a career slave named Gail
Crea who's based on a hundred women I know. She's got a great career, manages
fund-raising for a major museum, and work is going great. But then one day she
finds herself suddenly daydreaming about babies, envying moth­ers. She yearns
for someone to take care of, has a recurrent dream she's stealing a baby out of
a carriage on the street. It's demeaning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;God,&quot; Carly said, &quot;I know exactly what you're
talking about. I've been there. Have I ever.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The truth was, I also knew it all too well. It was poignant
and demeaning at the same time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Anyway, Gail's focused on career all through her twen­ties,
and by her late thirties she's become a serious profes­sional. But her personal
life is still on hold. She 'meets people' at work, or some other way, and she
has a couple of long-standing relationships that finally crater because the
guys, make that commit-ophobes, 'need space.' Along the way, there're ghastly
fix-ups and dismal dinners with what seem like a hundred thousand misfits. She
becomes the Dat­ing Queen of New York, but eventually she realizes all the men
she's meeting are either assuaging their midlife crises with some pneumatic
bombshell named Bambi, or they're divorced and whining and carrying a ton of
emotional bag­gage. The fact is, she's become the sensible, successful pro­fessional
she's been looking for all this time. This all sort of seeps in as back
story.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I perched on a stool at the breakfast bar and looked down at
my jeans, and noticed that a rip was starting in the crotch. Shit, back to
cottage cheese. Those horrible eight pounds I could never get rid of.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I crossed my legs. &quot;Finally, after she gets a couple
more promotions, she wakes up one morning and realizes she's never going to
have a family. All the stable, rational men have disappeared. Like there's a
black hole or something. Nothing's left but the walking wounded. She concludes
it's actually easier to get a baby than a decent guy—which is what she starts
trying to do. High concept: This picture is about how adopting a baby can
enrich the life of a childless human being and, not coincidentally, bring joy
to an or­phaned infant.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I remembered when I'd first pitched it to David Roth of
Applecore. His response had been; &quot;Definitely art-house. Probably never
get past the Angelika. A wide release is gonna be three screens where they
serve iced cappuccino.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was dead set to prove him wrong.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So,&quot; I wound up, &quot;I've shot the entire film,
but now, thinking it over, I've decided there's one last thing I need to do. As
I go through the story, at every step of the adoption process I want to cut to
an interview, just talking heads, tight shot, of somebody who actually went
through it. Nonfiction. The real-life happy ending. And that's where you come
in.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What I wasn't telling her was, I was increasingly con­cerned
the picture might be slightly hollow without this punch of real life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well,&quot; Carly declared with a grin, &quot;my ending
couldn't be happier.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, want to get started?&quot; I looked around at
Arlene, makeup, who always seemed to have more on her face than in her bag. I
kidded her about that a lot. But she was actually the one who had found Carly,
bumping into her at a gym in the Village.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, let's go for it.&quot; Arlene grinned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I turned back to Carly. &quot;So how's about we prep a little
while you're getting the 'natural' look?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the back of my mind I knew what I wanted for the
interview. Something like the feeling I remembered from <i>The Thin Blue Line</i>,
where people engaged in Hamlet-like mono­logues that told us more about them
than they themselves knew, that let us really know their secrets and their
fears. The interviewer was never seen or heard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arlene ensconced Carly at the dining room table, a weath­ered
country French, where she'd already unfolded and plugged in a mirror with
lights.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Having Kevin has been wonderful,&quot; Carly began.
&quot;He's changed my life. Sure, being a single 'supermom' makes for a lot of
bad-hair days, but no matter how much I complain, it's worth every burp.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I thought momentarily about having her hold him during the
interview, but instantly decided it would be too distract­ing. Kevin and his
wonderful eyes would commandeer the camera. A kid this cute in a scene was
nothing less than grand larceny.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He came toddling in now, dragging a stuffed brown bear. Then
he banged its head and tried to say its name. &quot;Benny.&quot; His funny,
awkward walk reminded me a little of Lou Cren­shaw after a couple of drinks.
God, he was fantastic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come here, sweetie.&quot; I picked him up, inhaling his
fresh baby scent, and wanted to hold him forever—while he slammed the bear
against my face. This child, I thought, is too good to be true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was wearing a small bracelet around his left ankle, a tiny
little chain, with a small silver medallion attached. It looked like the face
of a cat. Funny. Carly didn't have a cat, wasn't a cat person, so why the
little bracelet? And the back had a bunch of lines and dots, like a jumbled-up
Morse code.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ask her about that, I thought. But later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Carly was caught up in the sound of her own voice and on
a roll. While Arlene continued with the makeup, mov­ing to her eyes, she
bubbled on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Like I told you on the phone, I tried and tried to
adopt, through a whole bunch of lawyers, but it was a nightmare. One guy even
helped me put ads in newspapers all around the country, but nothing worked. I
kept getting scammed by women who wanted thousands of dollars up front, then
backed out at the last minute.&quot; She was getting up, looking intense.
&quot;Let me have a minute. I want to make coffee for everybody.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I followed her into the kitchen, which was the
&quot;country&quot; type with a faux granite counter and lots of
copper-bottomed pans hanging from the ceiling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was right about the pain of adoption, which was why her
story was such a burst of sunshine. As part of the start-up research for my picture,
I'd actually gone to meet an adoption attorney out in Brooklyn, a
sleazy-looking guy named Frank Brasco. I'd been pretending to be a client, to
find out first­hand how tough it really was. What I heard was chilling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't want to get your hopes up,&quot; he'd declared
for cheery openers. &quot;Finding a healthy, Caucasian, American baby is
virtually out of the question, so naturally we focus on foreign-borns. All the
same, it can take years, and there's incredible paperwork. Passports for the kid,
an extended visa for you while you go there and then wait around to process
everything in triplicate. Bribes, corruption, you can't imag­ine.&quot; He
sighed and adjusted his toupee, as though the very thought made him weary.
&quot;And that's just the foreign end. Here you have the INS, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service. They give bean-counting paper-pushers a bad
name.&quot; He examined me closely. &quot;Not Jewish, I take it. 'Cause if
that's what you're looking for, you may have to wait for the Messiah.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now, almost a year and a lot of experience later, I knew full
well how right he was. Which was what made Carly's story so fantastic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So how did you manage to get Kevin? You said it only
took a few months?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, to go back to the beginning, I didn't start out
want­ing to adopt. But when the guy I was planning to marry got cold feet—after
four and a half years, the louse—and there was nobody else on the horizon, I
decided to just have a baby on my own. You know, find some smart, good-looking
hunk, seduce him, and get things going the old-fashioned way, or if that didn't
work, then I figured I'd just go to a sperm bank. Who needs an actual man,
right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She took out a white and green bag of coffee beans, la­beled
Balducci's on the side. I was still holding Kevin, who threw Benny onto the
floor, then began to sniffle and point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But Carly seemed not to notice as she shook the coffee beans
into the grinder. &quot;Well, getting a baby the fun way turned out to be moot,
because it seems I have some kind of uterine condition—which meant I couldn't
get pregnant, or even do an in vitro. Bottom line, if I wanted a baby, I had to
adopt.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She pressed the button on the coffee grinder, sending a blast
of whirring through the kitchen. In seconds it was over and she was tapping the
batch into her Braun. &quot;So that's when I started on the attorney thing, got
worked over good trying to adopt as a single mom, and finally heard about
Children of Light.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The adoption organization? What do you know about
them?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell you the main thing,&quot; she said, &quot;they're
the place that can make it happen.&quot; She reached over and poked Kevin's
tummy. &quot;Right, big guy?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sure looked that way. What a cutie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By now the spacious living room had been turned into a mini
film set, with two 35-mm Panaflex cameras set up, windows blanked out, lights
and filters in place, and a video camera and monitor. Having tested the boom
mike and the tape recorder, Tony and Sherry were ready.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Carly announced to everybody that coffee was available, and I
handed Kevin over to Marcy. Then together we marched into the living room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay,&quot; I told her, &quot;we're going to be
filming, but ignore that fact. Just look into the back of the camera and talk
to it as though it were me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey.&quot; She grinned. &quot;You're dealing with a
pro. This is my thing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I looked around at the cameras and the grips. &quot;Okay,
guys. Roll sound.&quot; There was a retort as the clap stick used for synching
whacked out the start of the shoot. &quot;Scene one, take one, Carly Grove
interview.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She proceeded to hit the ground running, recounting in great
detail her story of many disappointments. She finally got to the point where
she was trying to adopt the baby of a woman in a Memphis jail, and then even
that fell through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Which was when my main lawyer, Chuck, just gave up and
recommended I hock the family silver, take a Valium, and try this place called
Children of Light. Where you go when all else fails. So I gave them a
call.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what happened?&quot; It sounded too good to be
true. &quot;Did they seem . . . in any way unusual?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked at me, as though puzzled by the question. Then she
shrugged it off. &quot;Well, first they tried to get me to check into their
clinic—it's this place up the Hudson—to let them see if my 'condition' could be
cured somehow, using his special techniques.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Goddard. Dr. Alex Goddard. He's a kinda spacey guy, but
he's the big-shot presiding guru there.&quot; She remembered the camera and
turned back to it. &quot;I told his staff I didn't have that kind of time, and
anyway nothing could be done. They were pretty insistent, so I eventually ended
up talking to the man himself. He sort of mesmerizes you, but I finally said,
forget it, it's adoption or nothing. So he just sent me back to the peons.
Checkbook time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I stared at her, hungry for details, but she didn't notice,
just pressed on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The money they wanted, I have to tell you, was stagger­ing.
Sixty thousand. And believe me, they don't give revolv­ing credit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I thought about the figure. It was the highest I'd heard for
getting a baby, but it wasn't totally off-the-wall. Terrific ba­bies don't drop
from trees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Carly was still going strong. &quot;It took me almost half a
year to scrounge it together. A lot of credit lines got maxed. But when I
finally did plunk down the loot, sure enough, I had Kevin in less than three
months. I don't even know where he came from. They took care of all that, but I
do know it was probably out of the country, because of the blank INS forms I
signed. But then, who cares? With a deal this good, you don't press for
details, right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Carly Grove had a mutual love affair with the camera. The
footage was going to be fabulous. The only problem was, it sounded like an
&quot;infomercial&quot; for the adoption miracle wrought by this doctor named
Goddard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When the interview began to wind down, losing its punch, I
suggested we call it a day. With the time pushing two o'clock, I wanted to get
the film to the lab, get it developed, and take a look at the rushes. I also
had a doctor's appoint­ment, not to mention a meeting with David to bring him
up to speed on what I was doing. But surely he was going to be pleased. The
interview, with Carly's honest intensity, would give the picture spine and
guts. Just as I'd hoped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>You could always tell by the reaction of the crew. Even Roger
Drexel, who usually hid his thoughts somewhere in his scraggly beard, was
letting his eyes sparkle behind his Panaflex. Scott was also grinning as he
struck the lights and Cafiero ripped up the power lines, now taped to the
floor. Everybody was in wrap mode, flushed with a great shoot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I followed Carly into the kitchen, where Marcy was feed­ing
Kevin some Gerber applesauce. The time had come, I thought, to spring the next
big question, out of earshot of the crew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I hate to put you on the spot, but do you know any
other women like you, single, who've adopted through Children of Light?&quot; I
decided to experiment with the truth. &quot;God knows, depending on what
happens in my own situation, I'm . . . I'm thinking I might even want to check
them out for myself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; She gave me a quick, concerned
look.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe I'd like to talk to them about adopting
too.&quot; I realized I was babbling, my usual prelude to obsessing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Carly's worried gaze eased up a bit, but she started twist­ing
at her hair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I might have another name. When my lawyer first
told me about them, he gave me the name of another woman who'd adopted from
them, and I talked to her a little about how they worked. She'd just gotten her
baby, so I guess she was about six months ahead of me in the process. Her name
was . . . I think it was Pauline or Paula or something. She's probably not the
kind of person who'd take their 'no disclo­sure' crap all that seriously. She
was adopting a girl, and she lives somewhere on the Upper West Side.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Any idea how I could find her?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, she wrote kids' books, and I think she gave
me her card. In case I ever needed somebody to do some YA copy. Let me go look
in my Rolodex. I filed her card under 'Y' for Young Adult. Right. It'll just
take a second.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The woman, whose name was Paula Marks, lived on West 83rd
Street. The business card, a tasteful brown with a weave in the paper,
described her as an author. The address included a &quot;suite&quot; number,
which meant she worked out of her apart­ment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mind if I take down her phone number and address? I'd
really like to look her up. To see if her experience was any­thing remotely
like yours.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Carly gazed at her fingernails a second. &quot;Okay, but do
me a favor. Don't tell her how you got her number.&quot; She bit her lip,
stalling. &quot;It's one thing for me to talk to you myself. It's something else
entirely to go sticking my nose into other people's business.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, I'll respect her privacy just as much as I
respect yours.&quot; I paused, listening to what I'd just said. The promise
sounded pretty lame. I'd just filmed her, or hadn't she no­ticed? &quot;Look,
let me call Paula, see if she'll agree to be interviewed on camera. I'll keep
your name entirely out if it, I promise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She reached down and plucked Kevin out of his high chair,
kissed him on his applesauce-smeared cheek, then hugged him. &quot;Sorry. Guess
I'm being a little paranoid. I shouldn't invite you here, then give you a hard
time about what you're going to do, or not do. I can't have it both ways.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the ensuing tumult and confusion of the wrap, I did manage
to get one more item from Carly Grove. The address and phone number of Children
of Light. But I completely forgot the one thing I'd been meaning to ask about.
That little amulet, with the strange cat's face and the lines and dots on the
back. Why was Kevin wearing it? And by the time I got to the street, surrounded
by the clamor of crew and equip­ment, it seemed too inconsequential to go back
and bother with.</span></p>

<h2><a name=bookmark4>Chapter Two</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='color:windowtext'>M</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>oving on, my next stress-point was to
meet with my young boss, the afore-noted David Roth, who was CEO and First Operating
Kvetcher of Applecore Productions, a kinda-sexy guy whose heart was deeply
engaged, often unsuccess­fully, with bottom lines. The issue was, I'd done
today's shoot, the interview with Carly, without troubling to secure his okay.
Without, in fact, telling him zip—the reason being I was afraid he wouldn't
green-light the idea. Now my next move was to try to convince him what I'd just
done was brilliant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Actually I liked David a lot, and hoped the occasional
tangles we'd had over the film wouldn't stand in the way of a friendship. The
truth is, you don't meet that many inter­esting, stable men in my line of work.
Our artistic goals weren't always in sync, but all the same, he'd done an enor­mous
favor for somebody close to me and for that I'd vowed to walk through fire for
him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I marched into his cluttered, dimly lit office, my mind
still churning over Carly's strange adoption story, what I saw sent my
problem-detector straight into the red. There, sitting across from him, was
Nicholas Russo, a five-seven smoothie in a charcoal Brioni double-breasted, the
gentleman David sometimes referred to as Nicky the Purse. Another land mine in
my life. He operated off and on as Applecore's &quot;banker&quot; when cash
flow got dicey and real banks got nervous. It was an arrangement of last
resort, since Nicky's loans had to be serviced at two percent a week. Do the
numbers: He doubled his money in a year. I knew too that putting money out to
independent filmmakers was part of Nicky's attempt at a legitimate front; the
real cash went onto the streets of Hell's Kitchen, just outside our door, where
he got five percent a week. And Nicky's overdue notices were not sent through
the mail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He also had a piece of a video distributorship, Roma Ex­otics,
that reputedly specialized in . . . guess what. It was all stuff I tried not to
think about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I had a strong hunch what was under discussion. The $350,000
David had borrowed to finish my picture. We'd gotten the loan three months ago,
when cash was tight, and we both figured we could pay it back later in the
year, after we got a backup cable deal (though I was ultimately hoping for a
theatrical distribution, my first).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shit! What did Nicky want? Were we behind on the weekly
juice? I'd signed on with David partly to help his bottom line. Was I instead
going to cause his ruin?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At the moment he had his back to Nicky, seemed to be
meditating out the window he loved, its vista being the grimy facades that
lined the far west of Fifty-eighth Street. His office, with its wide windows
and forest of freshly misted trees, told you he was a plant nut. Outside it was
early April, the cruelest month, but inside, with all the trees, spring was in
full cry. The place also felt like a storage room, with piles of scripts
stacked around every pot. The office normally smelled like a greenhouse, but
now the aroma was one of high anxiety.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>David revolved back and looked across the potted green­ery,
then broke into a relieved smile when he saw me. I could tell from his faraway
stare that he was teetering on the verge of panic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, come on in,&quot; he said. &quot;Nicky's just put
a brand-new proposition on the table.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>David had a keen intelligence, causing me to sometimes wonder
if he was in a line of work beneath him. (For that matter, maybe I was too.) He
was dark-haired, trim, with serious gray eyes and strong cheekbones. This
morning he was wearing his trademark black sweater, jeans, and white sneakers,
a picture of the serious go-for-broke New York indy-prod hustler. He'd already
made and lost and made sev­eral fortunes in his youthful career. My only sexual
solace since Steve left was an occasional glance at his trim rear end. I also
saluted his fiscal courage. His congenital short­fall, I regret to say, was in
the matter of judgment. Exhibit A: Nicholas Russo's funny money.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nicky, you remember Morgan James, the director on this
project.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah, we met. 'Bout four months back.&quot; Nicky rose
and offered his manicured hand, a picture of Old World charm. His dark hair was
parted down the middle and his Brioni, which probably fell off a truck
somewhere in the Garment Center, had buttons on the cuffs that actually
buttoned. &quot;How ya doing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi.&quot; I disengaged myself as quickly as possible.
The slimeball.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Again, why was he here? The way I understood it, we'd signed
a legitimate, ironclad note. Nicky wasn't exactly the Chase Manhattan Bank, but
I assumed he was a &quot;man of honor,&quot; would live by any deal David had
with him. &quot;Do we have some kind of problem?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nah,&quot; Nicky said, &quot;I'm thinking of it more in
the way of an opportunity. Dave, here, showed me some of your pic­ture this
morning, and it ain't too bad. Got me to thinking. You're gonna need a video
distributor. So maybe I could help you out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Oh, shit and double-shit. I looked at him, realizing what he
had in mind. &quot;How's that? Applecore already has a video distributor. We
use—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah, well, like I was telling Dave, I got a nose this
picture's gonna do some serious business.&quot; He tried a smile.
&quot;Whenever I see one of these indy things that don't add up for me, like
this one, I always know it's a winner. What I'm telling you is, I think you got
something here. He says you're figuring on a cable deal, and maybe a theatrical
release, but after that you gotta worry about video. I'm just thinking a way I
could pitch in.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Pitch in? The last thing I needed was some skin-flick wiseguy
getting his sticky hands on my picture. Forget about it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I don't really see how. I'm shooting this one by
the book. I've got a standard Screen Actors Guild contract, and everything is
strictly by the rules. If we're current on the loan, then . . .&quot; I looked
at David, who appeared to be running on empty. Maybe, I thought, I didn't
understand what was at stake. What had Nicky said to him? This was a man who
could make people disappear with a phone call to guys nicknamed after body
parts. &quot;Look, let me talk to David about this. I don't know what—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You two're just gonna 'talk' about it?&quot; Russo's
penetrat­ing eyes dimmed. &quot;Now that's a little disappointing, I gotta tell
you, since I sent for my business manager, Eddie down there in the car, hoping
we could reach a meeting of minds right here. Sign a few things. Roll that note
I'm holding into a distribution deal and give everybody one less worry.&quot;
He turned in his chair, boring in on me. &quot;Like, for instance, I checked
out your locations and I noticed there ain't no Team­sters nowhere. All you
got's a bunch of fuckin' Mick scabs driving them vans. Now that can lead to
circumstances. In­adequate safety procedures. Of course, that wouldn't have to
be a concern if we was partners together. Then you'd have good security. The
best.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I looked at David, who seemed on the verge of a heart attack.
Why was he letting this even be discussed? Get in bed with Nicky Russo and the
next thing you know he's got somebody hanging you out the window by your
ankles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Besides, ten to one the guy was bluffing, seeing if he could
scare us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I refocused. &quot;Mr. Russo, it may ease your mind to know
that our security is managed by a former agent for the FBI. He was with them
here in New York till about a year ago, when he came to us full time. His name
is Agent Lou Cren­shaw. You're welcome to check him out. He's familiar with
union issues, and he carries a .38. He also has plenty of friends down at 26
Federal Plaza. So if you have any linger­ing concern about our security
procedures, why don't you run it by him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The mention of Lou seemed to brighten David's listless eyes.
He leaned back in his chair and almost smiled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had good reason. The favor he'd done for Lou, and
indirectly for me, was enough to inspire eternal loyalty. Lou would face off
against half of Hell's Kitchen for David Roth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That ain't the point, exactly,&quot; Russo said,
shifting uncomfortably. &quot;Thing is, Roma could do good distribution for
you. We work with a lot of people.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then why not submit a formal proposal? In writing. I'm
in charge and that's how I do business. If your numbers work, then we can
talk.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just trying to be helpful.&quot; He glared at me, then
seemed to dismiss my presence. I disappeared from his radar as though lifted
away by an alien spacecraft, and he turned back to David. &quot;You know, Dave,
me and you've kinda drifted apart lately. Old friends oughtn'ta do that. We
ought to keep more in touch. I think we get along okay.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In other words, get this pushy broad out of my face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's just business, Nicky,&quot; David said, trying to
conjure an empty smile. &quot;Business and pleasure don't always mix.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes! David, tell the creep to leave us alone. Tell him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Doing business with me ain't a pleasure?&quot; Nicky
Russo asked, hurt filling his voice. He'd brought out a large Havana and was
rolling it in between his thumb and forefinger. &quot;I figured we was best
friends. <i>Paisans</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;We're not <i>not</i> friends, Nicky. We've
just got different goals in life. You know how it is.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I worked my way around behind his desk and glanced out the
window. The lingering day was beginning to cloud over, a perfect match for my
state of mind. After this I had a late appointment with Dr. Hannah Klein. I
feared she was going to end my baby hopes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah, well,&quot; Nicky Russo said finally, rising,
&quot;I gotta be downtown in a little while, so I guess we can talk about this
later.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, sure.&quot; David made a shrugging sign. Like:
Women! What can you do? Then he got up too. &quot;Look, Nicky, let me chew on
this. Maybe I'll get back to you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah, you think about it, all right?&quot; He rose
without a further word and worked his way out the wide double doors, stumbling
through the ficus forest as he struck a match to his cigar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;David, don't sign anything with him. Don't. I'll handle
the Teamster stuff if it comes up. I know how to talk to them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, okay, calm down. He was just seeing if he could
push me. I know him. You called his scam with that talk about Lou. By tomorrow
he'll forget about the whole thing.&quot; He looked at me, his eyes not quite
yet back in focus. &quot;Thanks. You can say things to him I'd get cement shoes
for. Nicky's not really ready for people like you. He has this macho front, but
he doesn't know how to handle a profes­sional woman with balls.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're welcome. I guess.&quot; Balls? I adored those
vulner­able male bits, but I preferred not to think of myself in those terms.
Truth was, Nicky Russo played a large part in my personal anxieties. &quot;But
I mean it. N. O.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I hear you,&quot; he said, sighing. Then he snapped
back to the moment. &quot;So where do things stand otherwise?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'd come for an after-the-fact green light of the day's
shoot, but already I was thinking about Hannah Klein. &quot;David, I'm going to
find out in about an hour whether Steve and I are ever going to have a baby. But
truthfully I don't think I'm pregnant. I think it's over.&quot; It hurt to say
it. He knew about Steve and me—I'd written some language on maternity leave
into my contract—and I think he was mildly rooting for us. Or maybe not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Could be it's all for the best,&quot; he declared. He'd
sat back down, picked up a pencil off his desk to distract himself, and was
whirling it pensively, one of his few habits that made me crazy. &quot;Maybe
you were destined to make movies, not kids.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I listened to his tone of voice, knowing he often hid his
real feelings with safe, sympathy-card sentiments. He rose to eloquence only
when nothing much was at stake. He'd even sent me flowers and a mea-culpa note
twice as a make­up after we'd had a disagreement over costs and scheduling. And
one of those times, I should have sent him flowers. Sometimes I wondered why we
worked so well together. The truth was, we operated on very different
wavelengths.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Some history to illustrate. Over the past eight years, before
I teamed up with David, I'd done three &quot;highly praised&quot;
documentaries. But getting to that point meant busting my behind for years and
years at the lower end of the profes­sional food chain. After NYU, I toiled as
a script supervisor on PBS documentaries, about as close to grunt work as it comes.
Eventually I got a fling as a production assistant, assembling crews, but then
the money dried up. (Thank you, Jesse Helms.) Whereupon I decided to try
capitalism, work­ing for three years as an AD on the soaps: first Guiding
Light, then As the World Turns, then Search for Tomorrow. I can still hear the
horrible music. Then a connection got me a slot at A&amp;E as a line producer.
Eight months later the series got canceled, which was when I decided the time
had come to take my career into my own hands. I hocked every last credit card,
went to Japan, and made a documentary. The result: I was an
&quot;overnight&quot; success. Men started addressing me by my name.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My first film was about the impact of Zen on Japanese
business. As part of my research, I shaved my head and lived three months at a
Kyoto temple, eating bean curd three meals a day, after which I had enough
credibility to land long in­terviews with Tokyo CEOs. I then sold the edited
footage to A&amp;E. When it became a critical hit, they financed a second film,
about the many gods of India and how they impact everything about the place.
There, I also got caught up in the mystical sensuality of ragas, Indian
classical music, and took up the violin (one of my major professional
mistakes). Next I moved on to Mexico's southern Yucatan to film a day in the
life of a Maya village for the Discovery Channel. They wanted me to add some
footage from Guatemala, but I scouted the country and decided it was too scary.
Instead, I spent several months in Haiti filming voodoo rituals, again for
A&amp;E. And met Steve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then one day I checked my bank account and realized that,
financially speaking, I was a &quot;flop d'estime.&quot; I was doing the kind
of work that does more for your reputation than your retirement plan. I decided
to go more mainstream and see what happened. But to do that I needed a
commercial partner, a backer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ironically enough, when I first teamed up with David, he had
bottom-line problems too, but from the opposite direc­tion. He was busy
disproving the adage that nobody ever lost money underestimating the taste of
the American public. He knew something was wrong, but what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Apparently, when he started out, somebody told him cable
audiences possessed an insatiable appetite for bare-skin-and- jiggle. Hey, he
figured, that stuff he could grind out in his sleep. His first, and last, epic
in the skin genre was <i>Wet T-Shirt Weekend</i>, whose title says it all. He
explained the eco­nomics to me once, still baffled why the picture hadn't
worked. He'd assumed all you had to do was find a bunch of nineteen-year-olds
who looked like they're sixteen, go nonunion someplace down South with a beach,
and take care the wardrobe trailer has nothing but string bikinis. &quot;Cost
only a million-eight to make,&quot; he declared with pride, &quot;but every
penny is on the screen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He insisted I watch it, perplexed that it was universally
regarded as a turkey. It was a painful experience, so much so I actually began
to wonder if his heart was really in it. (The great schlockmeisters secretly
think they're Fellini; they're operating at the top of their form, not
consciously pandering.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Chastened financially, he decided to move into low-budget
action-adventure. His efforts, most notably <i>Virtual Cop</i>, had car chases,
blue-screen explosions, buckets of fake blood. Somebody died creatively in
every scene.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They did business in Asia and Southern Europe, but he was
dumbfounded when nobody at HBO or Showtime would return his calls. It gnawed at
his self-esteem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was the moment we found each other. He'd just concluded
he needed somebody with a quality reputation to give</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Applecore an
image makeover, and I'd realized I needed somebody who knew more than I did
about the mechanics of making and distributing independent films.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We were an odd couple. I finally shook hands on the partnership
after he caved in and agreed I could do anything I wanted, so long as it looked
mainstream enough to get picked up by Time-Warner or somebody else legit. Well,
quasi-legit. We both agreed on no more bikinis and no more films about places
that required cholera shots. It was something of a compromise on both our
parts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thus far, though, we were getting along. Maybe luck was part
of it, but <i>Baby Love </i>was still on schedule and on budget. And I already
had a deal nearly in the bag with Lifetime, the women's channel, that would
just about cover the costs. Everything after that would be gravy. Again, hope
hope. Maybe not the theatrical release I'd been praying for, but good enough—so
he had to smile and not give me a hard time about the money I'd just spent. Had
to, right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I took a deep breath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;David, I did a little extra shooting this morning
that's kind of. . . outside the plan. But it's really important. Want to hear
about it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What! I thought you were finished with principal
photography.&quot; He looked disoriented, the deer in the headlights. Hints of
extra crew time always had that effect on him. &quot;You're saying this wasn't
in the budget?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just listen first, okay?&quot; Like a politician, I
avoided giving him a direct answer. I told him about the interview with Carly
and the reason for it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nice of you to share the news with me.&quot; His eyes
nar­rowed. &quot;I think we've got some big-time communication is­sues
here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, don't worry. I'll figure out how to save some
money somewhere else.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgy, before we continue this unnerving conversation,
we've got to have a serious review of the matter of cash flow.&quot; He
frowned, then went back to whirling the pencil, his hair backlighted from the
wide window, his eyes focused on its stubby eraser as though he'd just discovered
a new strain of bacteria. &quot;So let me break some news regarding the current
budget.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He put down the pencil, adjusted its location on his desk,
and looked up. &quot;I didn't want to have to upset you, since the picture
seems to be going so well, but we've drawn down almost all our cash. I actually
think that's why Nicky was here today, sniffing around, wanting to see a rough
cut. He's got a keen nose for indy cash-flow trouble.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you saying?&quot; It was unsettling to see
David turning so serious. &quot;Are we—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm saying we can cover the payroll here, all our fixed
nut, even Nicky's vig, for maybe six more weeks, if you and I don't pay
ourselves. Of course, if we can get an advance on some kind of cable deal, that
would tide us over more comfortably till this thing is in the can. But right
now we're sailing pretty close on the wind. I've bet Applecore on your picture,
Morgan. We can't screw this up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I swallowed hard. I knew we were working on the edge, but I
didn't know the edge was down to six weeks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;David, I'm all but ready for postproduction. I'm just
thinking I may need one more interview. Just a one-day shoot. I'm going to make
this picture work. You'll see.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He sighed. &quot;All right, if you think it's essential, get
the footage. Maybe I can even shake another fifty out of Nicky, if I string him
along about the distribution deal—don't look so alarmed, I won't go through
with it. Anyway, I can tell he's impressed with the picture so far. Happy
now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No, I wasn't happy. What was I going to do if Hannah Klein
had bad news? Adoption? I finally was facing the fact I'd possibly been making
a movie about myself all this time. Like Yeats, penning his own tombstone.
&quot;Cast a cold eye, on life, on death. .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So why not give him the whole story?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;David, if it turns out Steve and I can't have a baby,
I've begun thinking about trying to adopt.&quot; There it was. More pain.
&quot;Maybe I'm about to become the heroine of my own picture.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stared at me incredulously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgy, you of all people should know by now that adopt­ing
would take up all your energy, like a giant sponge. Come on. I've seen your
dailies. I got it, about how hard it is. You telling me now you didn't get
it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was right. Righter than he realized. But then I thought
again about Carly Grove, who'd found Kevin in no time at all, with zero
hassles. The only troubling part was that it was all so mysterious. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After I left David's office, I remembered I hadn't actually
had lunch, so I grabbed two hot dogs with sauerkraut (okay, it was junk, but I
secretly loved kosher franks) and a Diet Pepsi to go, from one of the
striped-umbrella vendors, then hailed a cab clutching the grungy brown bag.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was heading for Hannah Klein's office on the Upper West
Side. And now I had another clock ticking in addition to the biological one.
The big money clock in the sky was suddenly on final countdown.</span></p>

took only a few minutes for Hannah Klein's assistant, Lori, to run the
pregnancy test that confirmed my suspicions and settled my future. Steve's and
my final attempt, another intrauterine insemination (IUI, med-speak for an
expensive &quot;turkey baster&quot;) with the last of his deposit, had failed.
The end. The bitter end.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgan,&quot; Hannah declared, staring over her desk,
her raspy New York voice boring through me like a drill, &quot;given how this
has all turned out, maybe you ought to just start considering adoption—if
having a child still means that much to you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hannah Klein was pushing seventy, a chain smoker who should
have been dead a decade ago, and she unfailingly spoke the truth. Her gaze
carried only synthetic solace, but I was probably her fifteenth patient of the
day and maybe she was running low on empathy. Oddly, though, sitting there in
her office, miserable, I felt strangely liberated. I adored the woman, a child
of the Holocaust, with layers of steel like a samurai sword, but I also loved
the thought of never again having to go through the humiliation of cowering in
her straight-backed office chair, like a so-so student on probation waiting to
receive my failing grade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was now time to come to grips with what I'd known in my
heart for a long time. God had made me a theoretically functional reproductive
machine that just wouldn't kick over. Translation: no cysts, fibroids, polyps,
no ovulatory abnor­malities. My uterus and Fallopian tubes were just fine,
Steve's sperm counts were okay, but no baby was swimming into life inside me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sometimes, however, reality asks too much. It's not easy
getting your mind around the idea that some part of your life is over, finally
over. The baby part. To admit that it's time to move on to Plan B, whatever
that is. Such realizations can take a while, especially if you've been living
with high-level hope, no matter how irrational.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I frankly don't know what else we can do,&quot; she went
on, projecting through my abyss of gloom. She was shuffling papers on her
ash-strewn desk, white hair in a bun, fine-tuned grit in her voice. Upper West
Side, a fifty-year fixture. She never wore perfume, but to me she always
smelled faintly of roses mixed with smoke. Earthy. &quot;Aside from trying in
vitro.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We'd already discussed that, but it was definitely the bot­tom
level of Hell. Besides, I was running out of money, and spirit. And now, with
Steve gone, the whole idea seemed moot anyway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So,&quot; she concluded, &quot;barring that, we've done
everything possible, run every test there is, both on you and on your . .
.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Steve,&quot; I inserted into her pause. She seemed to
delib­erately block his name at crucial moments. Maybe she thought I could have
done better. Maybe a nice solid dentist who owned a suit instead of some
freelance photo jock who showed up for his sperm counts wearing khaki safari
shirts. Well, let her deal with it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;. . . and I can't find anything. Sometimes, the body
just won't cooperate. We may never know why. You've got to face that. But
still, adoption is always an option.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Adoption. All along I'd told myself I didn't have the cour­age,
or the heart. Making movies is a full-time job, not leav­ing time to go filling
out forms and jumping through hoops for years and years. And to cap it off, I
was just two years short of the big four-oh and financially struggling—hardly
an adoption agency's profile of &quot;ideal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But now, now I'd just discovered Carly Grove and the mir­acle
of Children of Light. So maybe there really could be a way to adopt a beautiful
child with no hassles. Maybe it would simplify everything to the point I could
actually pull it off. Could this be my Plan B? Then what if Steve came back?
Could we be a family finally?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I wasn't used to being that lucky. And I still wanted Han­nah
Klein's thoughts, a reality test, which was why I pressed her on the point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Truthfully, do you think adopting is really a workable
idea for somebody like me? Would I—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgan, I know you're making a film about the realities
of the adoption process. We both realize it's not easy.&quot; She must have
seen something needful in my eyes, because she continued on, adding detail,
letting the well-known facts con­vey the bad news. &quot;As you're well aware,
finding a young, healthy, American baby nowadays is all but impossible. At the
very least it can take years.&quot; She was fiddling with some papers on her
desk, avoiding my eyes. Then she stubbed out her cigarette in a gesture that
seemed intended to gain time. &quot;And even if you're willing to take a baby
that's foreign-born, there still can be plenty of heartbreak. That's just how
it is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd always thought so too,&quot; I said. &quot;It's
actually the un­derlying motif of my picture. But today I had an incredible
experience. I filmed an interview of a single woman, early forties, who just
adopted a baby boy. It took less than three months and he's blond and blue-eyed
and perfect. I saw him, I held him, and I can assure you he's as American as
peach cobbler. The way she tells it, the whole adoption process was a snap.
Zero hassles and red tape.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's most exceptional.&quot; She peered at me
dubiously. &quot;Actually more like impossible. Frankly, I don't believe it.
This child must have been kidnapped or something. How old, exactly, was he when
she got him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know. Just a few weeks, I think.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her eyes bored in. &quot;This woman, whoever she is, was
very, very lucky. If what she says is true.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The organization that got the baby for her is called
Chil­dren of Light,&quot; I went on. &quot;That's all I know, really. I think
it's up the Hudson somewhere, past the Cloisters. Have you ever heard of
them?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dr. Hannah Klein, I knew, was pushing three score and ten,
had traveled the world, seen virtually everything worth seeing. In younger
years she was reputed to have had torrid liaisons with every notable European
writer on the West Side. Her list of conquests read like an old New Yorker
masthead. If only I looked half that great at her age. But whatever else, she
was unflappable. Good news or bad, she took it and gave it with grace. Until
this moment. Her eyes registered undis­guised dismay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You can't mean it. Not that place. All that so-called
New Age . . . are you really sure you want to get involved in something like
that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I found myself deeply confused. Were we talking about the
same thing? Then I remembered Carly had said some­thing about an infertility
clinic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Frankly, nobody knows the first thing about that
man,&quot; Hannah raged on. &quot;All you get is hearsay. He's supposedly one
of those alternative-medicine types, and a few people claim he's had some
success, but it's all anecdotal. My own opinion is, it's what real physicians
call the 'placebo effect.' If a patient believes hard enough something will
happen, some of the time it actually might. For God's sake, I'm not even sure
he's board-certified. Do yourself a favor and stay away. Oftentimes, people
like that do more harm than good.&quot; Then her look turned inquisitive.
&quot;Did you say he's providing children for adoption now? That's peculiar.
When did he start that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was I hearing some kind of professional jealousy slipping
out? Hannah Klein was definitely Old School to the core.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He who?&quot; I was trying to remember the name of the
doctor Carly had mentioned. &quot;You mean—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He says his name is . . . what? Goddard? Yes, Alex
Goddard. He's—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My pager chirped, interrupting her, and she paused, clearly
annoyed. I looked down to see a number I knew well. It had to be Lou Crenshaw,
our aforementioned security guard. He'd been off today, but there was only one
reason he would page me: some kind of news from Lenox Hill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe it was good news about Sarah! My hopes soared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Or maybe it was bad. Please, dear God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm sorry, Dr. Klein. I've got to go. Right now. It
could be a medical emergency.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She nodded, then slid open the top drawer of her desk and
handed me a list of adoption agencies. &quot;All right, here, take this and
look it over. I've dealt with some of them, letters of reference for patients
like you.&quot; She must have realized the insensitivity of that last quip, because
she took my hand and squeezed it, the closest we'd ever come to intimacy.
&quot;Let me know if I can help you, Morgan. Really.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Grasping the lifeless paper, I ached for Steve all over
again. Times like this, you need some support. I finally glanced down at the
list as I headed out. Sure enough, Chil­dren of Light was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why not? I wondered. They'd found Kevin, a lovely blond baby
boy, for Carly, a single woman, in no time at all. They</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>sounded like
miracle-makers, and if there was ever a moment for miracles, this was it.
Shouldn't they at least have been given a footnote?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I wanted to stalk right back and demand to know the real
reason she was so upset, but I truly didn't want to waste a moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Lou had paged me from a pay phone—he didn't actually have a
cell phone of his own—and I recognized the number as belonging to the phone
next to the Lenox Hill Hospital's third-floor nurses' station. When I tried it,
however, it was busy, so I decided to just get in my car and drive there as
fast as I could.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And as I battled the traffic down Broadway, I realized that
by diverting my mind from my own trivial misery to the genuine tragedy of
Sarah, I was actually getting my perspec­tive back. That was one of the many
things Sarah had done for me over the years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All right. Sarah and Lou, who figure so largely in this,
deserve a full-dress introduction, so obviously I should start by admitting I'd
known them all my life. Lou was my mother's half brother, three years younger
than she was, who came along after my grandfather widowed my grandmother in a
freak tractor rollover and she remarried a lifelong bache­lor neighbor. (I have
old snapshots of them, and I can tell you they all were cheerless, beady-eyed
American Gothics.) I'd arranged for David to hire Lou eight months earlier, not
too long after I came to Applecore. At that time he'd just taken early
retirement from the FBI, because of an event that shook us all up pretty
seriously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For some time now, Lou's been a rumpled, Willy Loman figure,
like a traveling salesman on the skids, shirts frayed at the collars, face
tinted from a truckload of Early Times. Over the past fifteen years I'd watched
his waist size travel from about thirty-three inches to thirty-seven, and I'd
guess it's been at least a decade since a barber asked him if he needed any off
the top. Natalie Rose, his spirited, wiry wife of thirty-seven years, succumbed
to ovarian cancer seven years ago last Sep­tember, and I know for a fact she
was the one who bought his shirts, provided him with general maintenance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My first memories of him were when he was a county sheriff in
a little burg called Coleman, smack in the middle of Texas, some fifty-five
long, dusty miles from the ranch where I grew up. When I was about fourteen, I
remember he gave up on that and moved to Dallas, there to enter train­ing for
the FBI. He eventually ended up in New Orleans, and then, after Natalie Rose
passed away and he more or less fell apart, he got transferred to New York,
considered the elephant graveyard of an FBI career.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Probably the reason I saw him as much as I did as a kid was
because of my cousin Sarah, his and Rose's only child. She was six years
younger than me, a lot when you're kids, but we were very special to each
other, had a kind of bonding that I've never really known with anybody since.
We spent a lot of time staying at each other's house, me the almost-grown-up,
and truthfully, I loved her helplessly, like a little sister. I always wanted
to think she needed me, which can be the most affirming feeling in the world. I
do know I needed her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was now lying in a coma, and the way she got there was
the tragedy of my life, and Lou's. To begin with, though, let me say Sarah was
a pretty blonde from the start, with sun­shiny hair that defined her as
perpetually optimistic—and who wouldn't be, given the heads she always turned.
(I was—am—blond too, though with eyes more gray than her tur­quoise blues, but
for me blond's always been, on balance, an affliction: Sexist film producers
assume, dammit, that you're a failed showgirl, or worse. I've actually dyed it
brunette from time to time in hopes of being taken more seriously.) Sarah and I
had always had our own special chemistry, like a com­posite of opposites to
make a complete, whole human being. Whereas I was the rational, left-brained
slave of the concrete, she was a right-brained dweller in a world of
what-might-be. For years and years, she seemed to live in a dream universe of
her own making, one of imagination and fanciful states.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Once, when she was five, Lou hid in his woodworking shop for
a month and made an elaborate cutaway dollhouse to give her at Christmas. But
when I offered to help her find little dolls that would fit into it, she
declared she only wanted angels to live there. So we spent the rest of the
winter—I dropped everything—hunting down Christmas tree ornaments that looked
like heavenly creatures. She'd swathe them in tinsel and sit them in balls of
cotton she said were little clouds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I always felt that just being around her opened my life to
new dimensions, but her dream existence constantly drove Lou and Rose to
distraction. I think it was one of the reasons he never got as close to her as
he wanted, and his feelings about that were deep frustration, and hurt. He
loved her so much, but he could never really find a common wavelength.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally she came down to earth enough to start college, and
eventually she graduated from SMU in biology, then enrolled at Columbia for
premed. By then she was interested in the workings of the brain, in altered
states. I didn't know if it was just more pursuit of fantasy, but at least she
was going about it professionally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Anyway, when Lou got transferred to New York, he was actually
delighted, since it gave him a chance to be closer to her. We all managed to
get together for family reunions pretty often, though Lou and Sarah were
talking past each other half the time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then tragedy struck. She was just finishing her master's, and
had been accepted by Cornell Medical—Lou was burst­ing with pride—when he
suggested they use her Christmas break to drive back down to Texas together,
there to visit Rose's grave. (I think he really wanted to show off his bud­ding
doctor-to-be to the family.) Sarah was driving when they crossed the state line
into Louisiana and were side-swiped by a huge Mack eighteen-wheeler, which was
in the process of jackknifing across a frozen patch of interstate. They were
thrown into the path of an oncoming car, and when the blood and snow were
cleared, a six-year-old girl in the other vehicle was dead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The result was Sarah decided she'd taken a human life. Her
own minor facial cuts—which Lou immediately had re­paired with plastic
surgery—somehow evolved into a major disfigurement of her soul. All her mental
eccentricities, which had been locked up somewhere when she started col­lege,
came back like a rush of demons loosed from some Pandora's box deep in her
psyche. She dropped out of school, and before long she was in the throes of a
full-scale mental meltdown. She disappeared, and in the following two years Lou
got exactly one card from her, postmarked in San Fran­cisco with no return
address. He carried it with him at all times and we both studied it often,
puzzling over the New Age astrological symbol on the front. The brief note
announced she'd acquired &quot;Divine Energy&quot; and was living on a new
plane of consciousness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then eight months ago, the State Department notified Lou she
was missing in Guatemala. She'd overstayed her visa and nobody knew where she
was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So how did her &quot;new plane of consciousness&quot; land
her in Central America? Was that part of the fantasy world she'd now returned
to? Lou still worked downtown at 26 Federal Plaza, but he immediately took a
leave of absence and, though he spoke not a syllable of Spanish, plunged down
there to look for her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was there a month, following false leads, till he finally</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>ran into a
Reverend Ben Jackson, late of a self-styled Prot­estant ministry in
Mississippi, who was one of the ardent new Evangelicals swarming over Central
America. The man mentioned that some chicle harvesters in the northwest Peten
Department of Guatemala had found a young woman in an old dugout canoe on the
Guatemala side of the wide Usumacinta River, near a tributary called the Rio
Tigre, lodged in amongst overhanging trees. She'd been struck on the head and
presumably set adrift somewhere upriver, left for dead. She was now in a coma,
resting at Jackson's &quot;Jesus es el Hombre&quot; clinic, also located deep
in the northwest Peten rain forest. He had no idea who she was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Lou rented a car and drove there, almost a day on unpaved
roads. It was Sarah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thus she was no longer missing; she was now the apparent
victim of an attempted murder. However, rather than being helpful, the local <i>policia</i>
appeared annoyed she'd been found, thereby reopening the matter. A blond <i>gringa
</i>was out hiking somewhere she had no business being in the first place and
tripped and hit her head on something. Where's the crime?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Lou brought her back to New York, using a medevac plane
supplied by the State Department, which, wanting no more CIA-type scandals of
American nationals being murdered in Guatemala, cooperated with great dispatch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After that, he needed a job that would afford him time
flexibility, so he could be at her bedside as much as possible. David was
looking for a security head, and I realized it would be a perfect match. Since
we didn't really need a full-time person, Lou could spend a lot of hours at
Lenox Hill, watch­ing over Sarah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was just lying there now, no sign of consciousness, her
body being kept alive with IV I'd go by to visit her as much as I could, and
almost as bad as seeing the comatose Sarah was seeing the grief in Lou's eyes.
He would sit there at the hospital every day, sometimes several hours a day,
fingering an old engraved locket that carried her high-school graduation
picture, just rubbing it through his fingers like a rosary. We always made
allowances when he wanted to take time off during one of our shooting
schedules, figuring maybe he was helping her. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I turned east, to go crosstown, I thought again about
Sarah's condition. She and I looked a lot alike, dense blond hair for one
thing, but to see her now you'd scarcely know it, since hers had been clipped
down to nothing by the hos­pital. Her cheekbones, however, were still strong, a
quality now exaggerated by her emaciated state, and her eyes, which I had not
seen in years, were a deep languid, turquoise blue. But seeing her lying there
inert, being kept alive with tubes and liquids, wearing pressure pants to help
circulate blood through her legs, you'd scarcely realize she'd been a strik­ingly
beautiful woman before the accident.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What's worse, from what I knew, the horrific brain trau­mas
that bring on a coma don't automatically go away when you regain consciousness.
If the coma is the result of a head injury, and if it lasts more than a few
days, the chances of regaining all your mental functions are up for grabs. Lou
once said there's a scale of eight stages to full recovery. Peo­ple who have
short comas can sometimes come out of them and go through those stages
quickly—from initial eye move­ment to full mental faculties. Others, who've
been under for months or longer can require years to come back. Sometimes they
can only blink their eyes to answer questions; sometimes they babble on
incessantly. They can talk sense, or they can talk nonsense, incoherent
fantasies, even strings of numbers. The brain is a complex, unpredictable
thing. . . </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I always thought about this as I took the elevator up to
Lenox Hill's third floor. The room where they kept Sarah was painted a pale,
sterile blue, and made even more de­pressing by stark fluorescent lights.
Everything was chrome and baked-on enamel, including the instruments whose CRT
screens reported her bodily functions. None of the instru­ments, however, had
ever shown the brain activity associated with consciousness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Lou was there when I walked in. He had a kind of wildness in
his eyes, maybe what you get when you mix hope with despair. We hugged each
other and he said, &quot;She had a mo­ment, Morgy. She knew me. I'm sure she
did.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he told me in detail what had happened. A nurse passing
Sarah's room had happened to notice an unexpected flickering on one of her
monitors. She'd immediately in­formed the nurses' station, where instructions
included Lou's home number.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd grabbed a cab and raced there. When he got to her room,
he pushed his way past the Caribbean nurses and bent over her, the first time
he had hoped a conversation with her would be anything but a monologue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Honey, can you hear me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was no sign, save the faint flicker of an eyelid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was enough. His own pulse rocketed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where's the damned doctor?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While the physician was being summoned, he had a chance to
study her. Yes, there definitely was some move­ment behind her eyelids. And her
regular breathing had be­come less measured, as though she were fighting to
overcome her autonomic nervous system and challenge life on her own.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally an overworked Pakistani intern arrived. He pro­ceeded
to fiddle with the monitors, doing something Lou did not understand. Then
without warning—and certainly attrib­utable to nothing the physician did—Sarah
opened her eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Lou, who had not seen those eyes for several years, caught
himself feasting on their rich, aquatic blue. He looked into them, but they did
not look back. They were focused on infinity, adrift in a lost sea of their own
making. They stared at him a moment, then vanished again behind her eyelids.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He told me all this and then his voice trailed off, his de­spair
returning. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Lou, it's a start. Whatever happens is bound to be
slow. But this could be the beginning. . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We both knew what I was saying was perilously close to
wishful thinking, but nobody in the room was under oath. For the moment,
though, she was back in her coma, as though nothing had changed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I waited around until eight o'clock, when I finally con­vinced
myself that being there was not doing anybody any good. Lou, I later learned,
stayed on till well past eleven, when they finally had to send security to
evict him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay, I've been holding out on the most important detail. The
truth is, I hardly knew what to make of it. At one point when I was bending
over Sarah's seemingly unconscious face, her eyes had clicked open for just a
fleeting moment, startling me the way those horror movies do when the
&quot;un-dead&quot; suddenly come alive. Lou was in his chair and didn't see
it, didn't notice me jump.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The last thing I wanted to do was tell him about it, and I
was still shivering as I shoved my key into the Toyota's ig­nition and headed
for home. She'd looked directly into my eyes, a flicker of recognition, and
then came the fear. She sort of moved her mouth, trying to speak, but all that
came was a silent scream, after which her eyes went blank as death and closed
again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She knew me, I was sure of it, but she had looked through me
and seen a reminder of some horror now locked deep in her soul.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><a name=bookmark6>Chapter Four</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='color:windowtext'>L</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>ou took the next few days off to
spend by Sarah's side, but nothing more happened. I repeatedly called him at
the hospital to check on her, though it was becoming clear her brush with
consciousness had only been an interlude. Finally, I decided to show Carly's
rushes to David (he loved them) and try to concentrate on postproduction for
the rest of the week and the weekend, anything to make me not have to dwell on
Sarah's ghostlike, soundless cry of anguish.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Postproduction. When you're shooting a picture, you have to
make all kinds of compromises; but in post, with luck and skill, you can
transform that raw footage into art. You mix and cut the takes till the
performances are taut; you loop in rerecorded dialogue where necessary to get
just the right reading of a line; the Foley guys give you clear sound effects
where the production sound is muddy; and you balance the hues of reds and blues,
darks and lights till you get just the right color tone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All of the polishing that came with post still lay ahead. The
first step was to go through the rough cut and &quot;spot&quot; the film,
marking places where the sound effects or dialogue would need to be replaced
with rerecorded studio sound— which meant several days, maybe weeks, of looping
to edit out background noise and make the dialogue sound rich and crisp. For
some of it, the actors would have to come back in and lip-synch themselves,
which they always hate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was daunting, to have to work back and forth between
production sound tracks and loop tracks, blending alternate takes. You had to
figure on only doing about ten minutes of film a day, and then, after all that,
you had to get the &quot;opticals&quot; right, the fade-outs and dissolves and,
finally, the credit sequences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Normally, once I started post, I would have exactly ten weeks
to accomplish all that before the executive producer, David, got his hands on
my picture. That was the prerogative that was part of the standard director's
contract. Now, though, I figured that was out the window. With the money going
fast, I had to produce a rough cut and get the picture sold to cable in six
weeks, period.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But first things first. I deeply needed at least one more
interview—Carly's was too much of a happy one-note— which was why I needed to
shoot Paula Marks. It was now on for Thursday, today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The appointment had taken all weekend, including a Sun­day
brunch, to set up, but by that time I was sure this second mother would be
perfect. She was a tall, willowy woman, forty-three, who had let her hair start
going to gray. Honesty, it was right there in her pale brown eyes. She wrote
children's books, had never married—she now believed she never would—and had
decided to adopt a child because she had a lot of extra love she felt was going
to waste. Different from Carly Grove, maybe, but not in the matter of strength,
and fearless independence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We arrived around ten A.M. to discover her apartment was in
one of those sprawling prewar West Side monoliths, thick plaster walls and a
rabbit's warren of halls and foyers, legacy of an age before &quot;lofts&quot;
and open spaces. Terribly cramped for shooting. But Paula agreed to let the
blue-jeaned crew move her old, overstuffed couch out of the living room, along
with the piles of books that lined the walls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Another issue was makeup. At first Paula insisted she didn't
want any. Never wore it, it was deceitful, and she didn't want to appear on
camera looking like Barbie. (Small chance of that, I thought. A little war
paint now and then might help your chances of landing a father for this child.)
Eventually Arlene persuaded her that cameras lie and the only way to look like
yourself is to enhance those qualities that make you you. It was a thin
argument, but Arlene came from a long line of apparel proprietors who could
unload sunlamps in the Sahara.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Paula's adopted daughter Rachel, who was a year and a half
old, was running around the apartment, blond tresses flowing, dragging a doll
she had named Angie. Except the name came out &quot;Ann-gee.&quot; She was
immediately adopted by the crew, and Erica, the production manager, was soon
teaching her how to play patty-cake. Then Rachel wanted to demonstrate her new
skills at eating spaghetti. In five min­utes she was covered head to toe in
Ragu tomato sauce.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When the Panaflex was finally rolling, the story Paula spun
out was almost identical to the one told by Carly Grove. She'd spent hours with
all the legal services recommended by NYSAC, New York Singles Adopting
Children, listening to them describe a scenario of delays and paperwork and
heartache. It could be done, but it could take years. Look, she'd declared,
I'll cash in my IRA, do anything, just give me some hope. Okay, they'd replied,
tighten your belt, scare up sixty big ones, and go to see Children of Light. We
hear stories. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Soon after she called them, the skies had opened. A New Age
physician and teacher there, a man with striking eyes named Alex Goddard, had
made it happen. Rachel was hers in just four months, no paperwork.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sure, she declared, Children of Light was expensive, but Alex
Goddard was a deeply spiritual man who really took the time to get to know you,
even practically begged you to come to his clinic-commune and go through his
course of mind-body fertility treatment. But when she insisted she just wanted
to adopt, he obligingly found Rachel for her. How could she be anything but
grateful? She was so happy, she wanted everybody in the world to know about
him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she bubbled on, I found my attention wandering to Rachel,
who'd just escaped from the crew keeping her in the kitchen and was running
through the living room, singing a song from Sesame Street. Something about the
way she moved was very evocative.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Where've I seen her before? Then it dawned on me. Her walk
made me think of Kevin. Actually, everything about her reminded me of Kevin.
Were all kids starting to look the same? God, I wanted them both.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yeah, I thought, daydreaming of holding her, she's Kevin all
over again, clear as day. She's a dead ringer to be his older sister. It feels
very strange.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Or maybe I was just seeing things. To some extent all babies
looked alike, right? That is, until you have one of your own.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I had to swallow hard, to try to collect my thoughts. Carly
and Paula scarcely even knew each other. If Rachel really was Kevin's sister,
they'd never know anything about it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Incredible . . . it was just too big a coincidence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But still. . . and what about the film footage? Show close-
ups of the kids, and anybody not legally blind was going to see the similarity.
. . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why would somebody give up two children for adoption? I found
myself wondering. Giving up one was tragic enough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Cut.&quot; I waved at everybody. &quot;Take ten. We
need to re­charge here, take a break and stretch.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Paula was caught off guard, in the middle of a sentence, and
she let her voice trail off, puzzled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, I'm sorry Rachel came barging in,&quot; Paula
finally said. &quot;Guess she broke everybody's concentration, huh?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah, well, sometimes we all need to lean back and take
a fresh run at things.&quot; I called to Rachel, who came trotting over,
spaghetti sauce still on her face, and picked her up. I felt at a loss about
what to do. Tell Paula her daughter had a younger brother in the Village, and
she might fall apart. &quot;I was actually curious about something. Do you know
any­thing about Rachel's birth mother?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't want to know. It would disrupt my life. And my
peace of mind.&quot; Her eyes acquired a kind of sadness mingled with anxiety.
&quot;I'm reconciled to the fact she probably got into some kind of trouble,
may not have exactly been Nobel Prize material, but I'm a big believer in
nurture over nature. That's why I write books for kids. So I think Rachel's
going to end up being a lot more like me than like her real mother.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Brave words. But I'll bet you anything the story of Ra­chel's
mother is a lot more complicated than you imagine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I glanced at my watch, the hour pushing four-thirty. Time to
call it a wrap. Besides, if we shot any more today, the crew would end up on
overtime, and David was getting in­creasingly nervous about my extra costs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I also needed a little downtime to reflect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, I think I've got enough footage to work with for
now. Let me just get the release signed take this film down­town, and get it processed.
Maybe we can come back for another shoot when I figure out exactly where this
is going.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Anytime. Just give me some notice and I'll try to have
the place cleaned up more next time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't worry. I like it to look real. Just sign the
release and I'll take it from there.&quot; I was about to set Rachel back on
the floor when something caught in my sweater. Looking down, I realized it was
a tiny charm bracelet, with two little medallions on it. One was a little red
plastic likeness of Pocahontas, the Disney character, and the other was a
silver face of a cat, long and stylized. And on the back, those cu­rious lines
and dots again, only these were arranged differ­ently from those on the one
Carly's boy Kevin had.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Paula, what's this? This cat. Where'd you get it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, that.&quot; She smiled. &quot;She was wearing it
when I got her, on a little silk cord around her waist, under her diaper. They
told me it was a gift from her real mother, a keepsake. Sort of breaks your
heart, but the way they said it, you want to keep it forever. . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment Erica was just plugging the phone back in, and
the second she did, the old, black Panasonic cordless began to ring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hang on a sec,&quot; Paula said. &quot;Let me get that.
My agent is supposed—&quot; She'd picked up the phone and was plopping back
onto the couch. &quot;Hi.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then her look turned blank. &quot;No, of course not.&quot;
She fell into an uncomfortable pause, looking around at everybody. Then she
continued. &quot;Nobody's contacted me.&quot; She halted again, her face white,
and stared directly at me. I abruptly sensed that I was the topic of the
conversation. &quot;Sure I'm sure. . . . Yes, I remember signing. . . . Don't
worry. I'd have no reason to. . . . Okay, sure, I'll let you know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She clicked off the phone and looked up with startled eyes.
&quot;It was somebody who said they worked for Children of Light. She wanted to
know if you'd contacted me.&quot; Her face collapsed. &quot;You. She asked me
specifically about <i>you</i>. By name. How did—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;I have no idea.&quot; My hands were growing
cold. Had Carly told them about me? Why would she do that? &quot;Anyway, you
handled it okay.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which made me wonder. If Children of Light was such a perfect
organization, why was Paula so frightened she immediately felt compelled to
lie, to swear she hadn't broken their rules?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right.&quot; Her composure was slowly coming back.
&quot;Look, now that I think about it, why should they care? It doesn't make
any sense. They got their money.&quot; She turned to me. &quot;Let me have that
release.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She seized the paper and endorsed it with a flourish.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My pulse was still in overdrive, but I hugged her, then
signaled the crew that shooting was over for the day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, everybody. Time to wrap.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The gang immediately began striking the lights and rolling up
electrical cords. They would take the equipment back downtown and deliver the
film to the lab, while I would head home. It had been a long day and lots of
thinking was needed. Besides, it was starting to rain, a dismal spatter against
Paula's grimy windows, as the gray spring afternoon had begun darkening toward
sullen evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Listen, I enjoyed this.&quot; Paula had taken Rachel in
her arms and was stroking her blond hair. &quot;I really love talking about
her. She's changed my life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I gave her another hug. &quot;You're great. And you're going
to be wonderful in the film.&quot; If I used her. The whole thing was getting
unnerving. &quot;You have no idea how much you've helped.&quot; Then I said
good-bye to Rachel, who responded with a perfect &quot;Bye, bye&quot; through
her haze of spaghetti sauce.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay, get the superintendent. Crank up the freight eleva­tor.
Get out of here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Scott Ventri, key grip, took charge of handling the gear,
dictating which equipment got loaded on first. I watched long enough to make
sure everything was going okay, and then I joined Arlene, old friend and queen
of outrageous makeup, on the other elevator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You notice it?&quot; she whispered. The door had just
closed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Notice what?&quot; I knew full well what she was
talking about. But it just felt too bizarre.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Those kids could almost be twins. That little boy last
week, and this girl. They look just alike. It's spooky.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Guess their parents couldn't figure out what was
causing those pregnancies. So they just kept having more babies.&quot; I
decided to try to insert some humor, deflect the conversation. &quot;Maybe we
should tell Paula and Carly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Very dumb.&quot; Arlene bit at a long, red, false
fingernail, a perennial habit for as long as I'd known her. &quot;We should
mind our own business, that's what we should do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Works for me. But it also proves we were smart not to
shoot any footage of the kids. The whole world would realize something's
funny.&quot; Then I had an idea. &quot;Want to come downtown to my place after
we unload? Have some deep thoughts over what all this means?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>First the kids, then the call. What was this guy Alex God­dard,
whoever he was, up to? Definitely time to talk to some­body. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Gee, I'd love to,&quot; Arlene was saying, &quot;but I
can't. I gotta go out to Kew Gardens for my mom and dad's anniversary tonight.
Their thirty-fifth, can you believe? Of course, I was a very late baby.&quot;
She blinked her dark, languid eyes, as though rehearsing the line for a
downtown club.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A miracle of modern fertility science, right?&quot;
Shit. Ar­lene, I need you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right.&quot; She giggled, then seemed to study the
flashing lights on the elevator's control panel. &quot;God, those kids, they're
too good to be true. I'd love to have one like that.&quot; She impatiently
pounded the number one a couple of times, perhaps hoping to speed our creaky
descent. &quot;I can get bonked every night of the week, but I can't get a
serious boyfriend. New York's clubs aren't exactly brimming with the
vine-covered-cottage-and-picket-fence type. And as for the pickings at work,
given the kind of pictures David makes, forget it. Last thing I need is some
twenty-year-old pothead who thinks with his wang.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm afraid I'm not helping you much with this
one.&quot; I'd cast <i>Baby Love</i> mostly with Off-Broadway unknowns. The
actress Mary Gregg was a veteran of Joseph Papp's original Public Theater, the
experimental enterprise downtown. The few male parts all went to guys who were
either gay or mar­ried.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oy, what can you do, right? If it happens, it
happens.&quot; Arlene watched the door begin to stutter open as we bumped onto
the lobby level. Then she zeroed in on me. &quot;You really want a kid too,
don't you? I mean, that's why you did this script, right? Which, by the way, is
great. I mean the script.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think most women do, down deep.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She smiled. &quot;Well, if I ever have one, it's going to be
the old-fashioned way. It's a heck of a lot cheaper than adopting.&quot; She
was heading out, into the front foyer. &quot;Not to mention more fun getting
there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On that I definitely had to agree.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The lobby's prewar look was gray and dismal, and as we
emerged onto the street, the rain had turned into a steady downpour. Lou was
off again today, down at the hospital with Sarah, so I'd engaged a doorman from
a new co-op across the street to keep an eye on our vans. A crisp twenty had
extracted his solemn promise to do just that. At the mo­ment, however, he was
nowhere to be seen. Proving, I sup­pose, David's theory that we needed our own
security guy at all location shoots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Lou, I thought, I hope you're finally getting through to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No limo, but at least we get first call on the
vans,&quot; Arlene observed, her voice not hiding the sarcasm. &quot;Just once
I'd</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>like to work
for somebody who had serious VIP transporta­tion.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;David would walk before he'd get a limo.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We were headed down the street, me digging out my keys, when
I noticed the man standing in the rain. He was just behind our lead van, a
three-year-old gray Ford, waiting for us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My first thought was he must be connected to Nicky Russo,
David's wiseguy banker, here to bust my chops over the Teamster issue. Screw
him. Just my luck he'd send some­body the very day Lou was not on hand. But
then I realized I'd guessed wrong. The man was more Hispanic than Italian. He
also was short, solidly built, late fifties maybe, with in­tense eyes and gray
hair that circled his balding pate like the dirty snow around a volcano's rim.
As he moved toward us, I thought I detected something military in his bearing,
not so much the crispness of a soldier but rather the authoritative swagger of
an officer. Well, maybe a retired officer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The paper on your windshield says you are filming a
movie,&quot; came a voice with a definite Spanish accent. No greetings, no
hiya, how're you doin'? Just the blunt state­ment. Then, having established
what was already clear to all at hand, he continued. &quot;It says the title is
<i>Baby Love</i>. Why are you making this movie here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>That was it. I glanced at Arlene, who'd turned white
as a sheet. You get a lot of onlookers around a location shoot, but not too
many who challenge your right to exist, which was exactly what was coming
through in his menacing tone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I handed Arlene the keys. &quot;Here, go ahead and open up.
I'll handle this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I turned back to him. &quot;What you saw in the wind­shield
of the vans is a New York City Film Board permit. That's all the information we
are required to provide. If you read it, you know everything I'm obliged to
tell you.&quot; I re­turned his stare. &quot;However, if people ask nicely, I'm
happy to answer their questions.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you making this movie about a person in this build­ing?
Your other films have been documentaries.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>God help me, I thought. Is this what my fans are like?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then it hit me. I don't know how I'd missed the connec­tion,
but now it just leapt out. First the phone call, then this hood. Somebody was
tracking me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm scouting locations,&quot; I lied, feeling a chill
go through me. &quot;We're second unit for an action film, shooting some prep
footage for the producers. Does the name Arnold Schwarzenegger mean anything to
you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then why is the film about babies?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's meant to be a joke. Remember the movie <i>Twins</i>?
It's a joke title. Do you understand?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment, Paul Nulty came barging out the door with a
huge klieg light, followed by several other members of the crew carrying sound
gear. Our cordial tete-a-tete was about to be disrupted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My new Hispanic friend saw them and abruptly drew up. That
was when I noticed the shoulder holster under his jacket, containing some sort
of snub-nosed pistol.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jesus, I thought, this must be what some kind of hired killer
looks like. That gun's not a prop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think you are lying.&quot; He closed his jacket and,
ignoring my crew, bored in relentlessly on me, his eyes dead and mer­ciless.
&quot;That is a big mistake.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was the first time in my life I'd ever stood next to a man
who had a gun and was deeply ticked at me. He'd wanted me to see his piece,
just to make sure I took him seriously. He wasn't threatening me, per se.
Rather he was letting me know how strongly he cared about what I was doing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, damn him, but I still was scared. I might have man­aged
to bluff Nicky Russo, but he was a guy who operated by an age-old set of
Sicilian rules. This thug didn't strike me as the rule-book type.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hand shaking, I pulled out my cell phone, flicked it open,
and punched in 911.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Listen, if you're threatening me with a gun, I'm
calling the cops. Whatever problem you have with the New York film industry,
you can explain it to them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>New York's police emergency number was still ringing as he
abruptly turned and strode away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I clicked the phone shut and moved to get out of the way as a
trolley loaded with more gear was rolled past me down the sidewalk.
Unfortunately, I also took my eyes off him for a second, and when I looked up
again, he seemed to have disappeared into the rain, though I did notice
somebody who could have been him get into a long black car well down the block
and speed off toward Broadway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What did that creep want?&quot; Arlene asked, coming
back with the keys.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was only slowly returning to reality, and it took me a few
moments to form a coherent answer through all the adrenaline surging into my
brain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I . . . I don't know. But I think I'd better warn
everybody to keep an eye out for strangers. He's . . . he's wound a little
tight, to put it mildly.&quot; I was still shaking, which she fortu­nately
failed to notice. At that point, there seemed no great reason to spook her with
mention of the gun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Boy, he wasn't just some homeless junkie,&quot; she
said. &quot;He looked like a heavy in one of David's old action pictures. All
he needed was a Mack-10.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right.&quot; Jesus, Arlene, I think he might have had
one. &quot;So let's get moving.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I watched the vans being loaded, slowly calming down, I kept
thinking about him. He was undoubtedly connected to the phone call, but why
would anybody be so worried about what I was doing? I couldn't think of any
serious rea­son.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Half an hour later we were all headed downtown. Along the
rain-swept streets the &quot;All Beef&quot; hot-dog vendors cow­ered under
their red-and-yellow striped umbrellas, while de­parting office workers,
briefcases perched above their heads as makeshift protection, scurried along
the edges of build­ings searching for cabs. While Arlene continued to chat non­stop,
I tried to do a little mental processing. And my mind kept drifting back to the
sight of little Rachel, and Kevin. What perfect kids. The way she was running.
. . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hey, wait a minute. How could they be siblings? Brother and
sister? Rachel was almost exactly half a year older than Kevin. Biology didn't
work that way. No way could they be related, but still . . . they looked so
alike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I realized Arlene hadn't put it together about the ages. The
brother/sister theory made absolutely no sense. Those kids were born six months
apart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If that wasn't strange enough, why did they both have those
tiny cat medallions with the lines and dots on the back? Which were actually
kind of creepy, more like sacred amulets than little toys.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Talk to Lou. He might have some insights.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No, better yet, go to the source. Children of Light. Call
Alex Goddard's adoption agency or clinic or whatever it is and make an
appointment.</span></p>

<h2><a name=bookmark7>Chapter Five</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='color:windowtext'>I</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> was feeling a bit off center that
evening, but I explained it away as mental overload, the rain, and the implied
threats. That diagnosis got revised the next morning when I awoke with a
mind-numbing headache, chills alternating with a mild fever, and my chest
feeling like it was caught in a com­pactor. It was a so-called common cold, but
there was nothing common about my misery, which was truly exceptional.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I made a cup of Echinacea tea and then washed down 2000 mg of
Vitamin C with some aging orange juice from my fridge, after which I took a
couple of Tylenol, put on yesterday's jeans, and headed uptown to work. I also
treated myself to a cab.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I settled into the cluttered corner room that was my
office, I told myself this was not a day to make any big decisions. Just stick
to matters that required nothing more than autopilot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The first thing I did was call Lou to check on Sarah (no
change), and then I told him about my Hispanic visitor. He made concerned
sounds and promised to accompany me on any further location shoots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next I pulled out my date book and punched in a phone number
I'd scribbled in the back. I'd gotten it when I was winding up my interview
with Carly Grove.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Children of Light,&quot; said an unctuous voice.
&quot;This is Ramala.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I hesitated a moment before giving my name. They already knew
who I was; Ramala or somebody had called Paula Marks and asked about me. Me.
What would she do when she heard it was yours truly in the flesh?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I tried to take a deep breath, working around the feeling my
lungs were on fire, and identified myself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ramala received the information as though she'd never heard
of me. Maybe she hadn't. Then I asked for an appoint­ment with Alex Goddard. As
soon as it was convenient.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He leaves his Saturdays open,&quot; she said, more of
the smiley voice, &quot;so I could make a special appointment for you tomorrow.
Would ten A.M. be all right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her accent was the kind of Delhi colonial-ruling-class you
associate with expensive silk saris and ruby bracelets, yet at the same time
her voice had an overlay of that melodious, touchy-feely unctuousness you hear on
relaxation tapes. I half expected her to next say, inhale deeply and feel the
love flowing through the universe. In any case, she couldn't have sounded more
open and forthcoming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I had to remind myself immediately that it wasn't true. Given
the inquisitive phone call to Paula Marks, Children of Light was an
organization that deeply cherished its privacy. Presumably they had a reason,
and that reason didn't neces­sarily have to be sinister, but still, I had every
reason to think they were upset about me and it made me paranoid. And now Alex
Goddard immediately had time for a &quot;special ap­pointment.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ten o'clock will be fine,&quot; I said, just barely
croaking the words out of my chest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She gave me directions for reaching the Riverdale clinic,
called Quetzal Manor, and hung up. I felt so miserable I could barely remember
afterward what she'd said, but fortu­nately I'd taken notes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Quetzal Manor. An odd choice for a name, I'd thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Some kind of
bird sacred to the Maya Indians of Central America. But then Paula had
mentioned at one point that he was very interested in indigenous Third World
herbs and remedies. So maybe it fit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But still, one big puzzle kept coming back to haunt: How do
you produce perfectly healthy siblings six months apart? (I actually called Carly
and Paula back to verify the ages.) The more I thought about Kevin and Rachel,
the more I realized they were so unmistakably related.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Puzzling over that, I began to wonder if maybe I was on the
verge of uncovering a blockbuster documentary. Could we be talking something
approaching science fiction here? Making documentaries, you're always on the
lookout for the unexpected, the fresh. So how about an organization that could
obtain beautiful Caucasian babies seemingly at will, including peas-in-a-pod born
a few months apart? I was al­ready framing a pitch to David in my mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Anyway, the rest of the day, while I was busy battling my
cold with antihistamines and lots of hot soup, I mounted a major phone inquiry
just to make sure all the rules on adop­tion hadn't somehow changed when I
wasn't looking. They hadn't. First off, to get a child in three or four months,
you'd almost certainly have to go with foreign adoption. China was everybody's
flavor of the month, because they favored older parents and also because the
one-child-per-family policy there had ended up producing a wide-scale
abandonment of girls (who were all those precious boys going to marry? I often
found myself wondering). However, the shifting poli­tics there made the process
very unreliable. A few months? Don't even think about it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Pressing on, I satisfied myself that the country-specific
organizations that found babies in the emerging parts of the world all still
worked the same. Cradle of Hope specialized in orphaned Russian kids. Children
and Families, Inc., provided adoptions for Equadorian children. International
Adoption Assistance, Inc., handled Brazilian orphans. But they all were still
fussy, and they could take ages. How about a brand-new healthy baby in just a
few months? I'd ask. Some kind of new fast track? The question was always taken
as a joke. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I would be driving up to Quetzal Manor in my old Toyota, and
I dearly wished Steve could somehow materialize and be with me. In his absence,
however, I convinced Lou to come along. I figured the change of scene would do
him good, and I also wanted the security of having him with me, after the
threatening phone call to Paula and the Hispanic thug who'd accosted me outside
her apartment building. Be­sides, it'd just be a couple of hours.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The next morning, as we trekked up Riverside Drive, then the
Henry Hudson Parkway, the sky was a flawless blue and the wide Hudson seemed
like an ardent highway leading into the heart of America. Still in elevated
spirits over Sarah's momentary brush with consciousness, Lou had noticeably
less of a hangover than was usual most mornings. Maybe he was looking forward
to a little mental R&amp;R. For my own part, I felt my curiosity growing. I'd
gone to a lot of appoint­ments over the years, but rarely did I suspect the
person I was going to see already knew more about me than I knew about them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After we crossed the Henry Hudson Bridge, we left the highway
and headed down a service road that led toward the river. Then there was an
imposing gate, open, and a tree- shrouded driveway. Finally the place loomed in
front of us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The physical appearance of Quetzal Manor was a study in
European grandeur, translated with a few extra frills from the New World. Carly
had told me it had once been a Car­melite convent, dating from sometime in the
middle of the last century, and it was a monument to Church authority, with
endless arches of cut stone, turrets, gargoyles. As we were motoring to the end
of the long cobblestone drive, I felt as if I was approaching some Gothic movie
set. Given its hovering sense of regal authority, the place could easily have
been a castle, but it seemed more like a brooding hom­age to medieval torture.
Let me just say it was truly magis­terial, yet also more than a little creepy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As we parked under a huge oak tree in front, I surveyed the
facade, trying to marshal my strength. Enough of my cold still lingered that I
didn't feel as if my mind was working on all cylinders, and for a moment I
merely sat looking, trying to breathe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Want me to go in with you?&quot; Lou asked finally. He
was examining the building suspiciously, like a detective survey­ing a crime
scene.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I wanted him with me and then again I didn't. I longed for
the company, a protector, but I didn't want the compli­cations, more things to
explain inside. Finally I made a snap decision.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why don't you take a stroll around the grounds?&quot; I
suggested. &quot;Commune with nature. The fresh air will do you good. This
can't take long. Mainly I just want to get some literature and try to gain a
feeling for the place.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That wasn't entirely, or even partly, true. What I really
wanted to find out was threefold: How did they manage to get beautiful healthy
Caucasian babies for two single women in just a few months; how could those
babies be only six months apart in age and still obviously be siblings; and
(this was where my feelings got complicated) could they get a baby for me the
same way, never mind how they did it. It was the third thing that actually
bothered me the most, since I was far from sure I wanted to be a part of
whatever was going on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Lou just shrugged and leaned back in his seat. &quot;Take as</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>long as you
like. I'll just wait here in the car. I'm not the nature type.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was certainly the case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I walked across the cobblestones to an arched entryway that
had no door. I wondered at this—most convents are like a fortress—and then I
realized the front door had been re­moved, leaving only its ancient hinges
still bolted into the stones. Perhaps it was intended to be a symbol of
openness, inviting you in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was no sign of anybody—the saccharine-voiced Ramala was
not on hand to greet me—so I just headed on down a wide hallway, past a table
of brochures. The place had been decorated with expensive good taste:
tapestries all over the stone walls, perfect Persian rugs, classic church
statuary—all of it calling forth powerful feelings from deep in the psyche.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I entered a vast interior courtyard, where a central
fountain splashed cheerily in the midday light. The courtyard was circled with
a picturesque gallery of cells, all with mas­sive wooden doors, most likely
rooms once inhabited by chaste sisters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The place did seem to be a clinic-commune now, just as Paula
had said. Not nuns this time around, but rather New Age acolytes whose tastes
ran more to secular music than to religious chants, as witness the cacophony of
sounds that wafted out from several of the cells. Only it wasn't any kind of
conventional music; it seemed a mixture of Japanese flute, North Indian ragas,
African drumming. I liked the ragas, even recognized my favorite,
&quot;Bhairavi.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I spotted something that riveted my attention. At the
back of the courtyard, just past a final wooden door, stood a huge South Indian
bronze statue, about five feet high, of the Dancing Shiva. It appeared to be
presiding over the arch­ way that led out into a dense natural garden behind
the build­ing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I walked across the cobblestones to examine and admire it. It
seemed an odd item to find here in the courtyard of a once-cloistered convent.
I was so enthralled I failed to hear the door behind me open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you find my Shiva interesting, Ms. James?&quot; said
a soothing voice, just barely audible above the chirps of birds. I think I
caught a breath in my phlegm-locked chest, but then I turned to see a tall man
dressed in casual chinos and a dark sweater. He was trim, looked to be in his
early sixties, with a mane of salt-and-pepper hair and lean features more
craggy than handsome. But his eyes were everything, telling you he owned the
space around him, owned in fact, the air he breathed. It had to be Alex
Goddard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes,&quot; I answered almost before I thought. &quot;It
just seems to be a little out of place here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I wondered if he was going to introduce himself. Then I
realized that when you're used to being the master of a pri­vate domain, you
probably never think to bother with such trivial formalities. Everybody knows
who you are.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, his voice disarmingly benign,
&quot;I suppose I must beg to differ. May I suggest you consider this Shiva for
a moment and try to imagine he's a real god?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He is a real god&quot; I said immediately feeling
patronized. Nothing makes me angry faster. &quot;In India, he's—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said &quot;I know you did a film about
India—which I found quite extraordinary, by the way—but why wouldn't the Shiva
fit right in here? You see, he's a very modern, universal figure. He
incorporates everything that exists in the contemporary world. Space, time,
matter, and energy. As well as all of human psychology and wisdom.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm aware of that,&quot; I said sensing my pique
increase. We were not getting off to a great start.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, well.&quot; He seemed not to hear me. Instead he
started putting on the leather jacket he'd had slung over his shoulder.
&quot;Notice that Shiva has four arms, and he's dancing with one foot raised.
He's also standing inside that great circle of flame, a sort of halo
encompassing his whole body. That circle stands for the great, all-embracing
material universe, all of it. Dark and light, good and evil. He knows and
controls everything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hey, I realized, this guy's got some kind of identity thing
going with this ancient Indian god.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He continued as he zipped up the jacket. &quot;Shiva has four
arms because—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me tell you,&quot; I said, interrupting him. He
looked star­tled, clearly not accustomed to a woman meeting him on his own ground.
&quot;He has four hands because he has a lot to do. That little drum in his
upper right summons things into exis­tence. And there in his upper left he
holds a fire that de­stroys.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Goddard was examining me curiously, but I just stared back
and continued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His lower right hand is held up in a kind of
benediction, as if to say, 'Find your peace within,' and the lower left points
down at his feet, where one foot is planted on the back of that repulsive
little dwarf there, the human ego. Crush the ego and be free. The other foot is
lifted to signify spiritual freedom.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You seem to know the Shiva well.&quot; He broke into a
grudging smile, as though we'd just met. Chalk up round one as a draw.
&quot;I'm glad you came, Ms. James. I'm a great admirer of your work and I especially
wanted to provide your orientation personally. It's a genuine pleasure to meet
you at last.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At last? I took his proffered hand and stared. All the ques­tions
I'd been brooding over for the past week sort of disap­peared into a memory
file somewhere. Instead all I could do was focus in on him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Meeting Carly and Paula's miracle worker in the flesh made me
recall something Aldous Huxley once observed. He declared that the kind of man,
and they are almost always men, who can control others with his mind needs to
have certain qualities the rest of us can only envy. Of course he has to be
intelligent and have a range of knowledge that can be used to impress people,
but most of all, he has to have a will of iron, an unswerving tenacity of
purpose, and an un­compromising self-confidence about who he is, what he wants.
This means a slightly remote manner, a glittering eye, and a sympathetic gaze
that bores in deeply on you one min­ute, then seems off in another realm,
focused on infinity, the next. Perhaps most importantly of all, his voice must
be that of a Pied Piper, a soft yet penetrating instrument that acts directly
on the unconscious of his listeners.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Even though he was doing a casual number with me, my first
impression of Alex Goddard was that he perfectly em­bodied all those qualities.
I also sensed a false note. What was it? Maybe he was being just a little too
casual.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you're here about doing a film,&quot; he began,
&quot;please be aware we do not encourage publicity. If you've come because of
your infertility, as Ramala said you mentioned in your call, then I welcome you
with open arms.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, he knew how to cut to the chase. And after his phone
call to try to intimidate Paula Marks, I was well aware he didn't
&quot;encourage publicity.&quot; But now I also realized he wouldn't be overly
interested in my new idea of someday doing a documentary on this place. But
then a lot of people say no at first and then come around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was actually interested in neither,&quot; I said,
feeling my sinuses about to close down permanently. &quot;I was actually hoping
to find out about your adoption service, how it works.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ah,&quot; he said, his eyes shifting from intense
scrutiny to somewhere lost in the ozone, &quot;that's not something I handle
personally. In any case, you first must come and participate in our program.
Then, if we fail to achieve your objectives, we can take the adoption matter
under consideration.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think I'd like to hear about it anyway.&quot; I took
a deep breath, again groping for air. &quot;For instance, where and how you get
the children you place.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I see,&quot; he said calmly, as though my question were
about the weather. Then he secured his coat tighter. &quot;I'm thinking, how
would you like to take a short walk? Down to the river. We could get to know
each other better.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I just nodded, not looking forward to the harsh wind that
would assault my inflamed sinuses. But maybe I was getting somewhere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As we started out through the stone archway and into the rear
garden, which seemed to extend for acres, he continued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You seem to have a lot of questions about what I'm
doing here. So let me try and put my efforts into perspective. As I like to
point out to women when they first come here, we in the West are making do with
only half the world's medical knowledge. We ignore all of the East. There's also
the wis­dom of the indigenous peoples here in the Western Hemi­sphere, the
Native Americans. Who are we to say they don't have a lot to teach?&quot; He
smiled, as though embarrassed to be passing along such a commonplace. &quot;For
example, West­ern medical practice, virtually until this century, consisted
mainly of using leeches to drain away 'humors' in the blood. At the same time,
the indigenous peoples of this continent knew more about the curative powers of
plants, even drugs, than Europe ever dreamed of. Yet they were deemed
savages.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I wasn't sure where he was leading, but the supreme self-
confidence with which he spoke had the effect of sweeping me along. The
engaging eyes, the voice, the well-used de­signer jacket, it all worked. He was
good, very good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So you see,&quot; he went on, &quot;what I've tried to
achieve here at Quetzal Manor is to integrate the knowledge of East and West,
ancient and modern.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So what, exactly, do you—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, first let me explain that I studied in the Far
East for over a decade, until I understood how to control the en­ergy flows in
the body, your Chi. Then I moved to Central America, where I learned all that
is currently known about Native American practices and medicines. I still have
a spe­cial place there, where I carry out pharmacological research on the rare
plants of that area, studying their effects on hu­man fertility, on the origins
of life. I have no time to waste on disease and degeneration.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We were well into his Eden-like rear garden now, which had
lots of herbs and was also part orchard. There were apple trees and other fruit
trees I couldn't readily identify, all just starting to show their first buds.
When we came to the end, there was a cobblestone path leading west. In what
seemed only a few moments, we'd reached a line of bluffs overlook­ing the
Hudson. The early spring wind was cutting into my face, causing my nostrils to
feel on fire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As we stood gazing down at the rippling waters of the Hudson
below, where a lone sailboat was caught in the breeze, the moment took on a
timelessness, feeling as though it could have been any place, any century.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Incidentally,&quot; he went on, turning slightly to me,
&quot;are you familiar with the name Asklepios?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I had to shake my head no. It sounded vaguely familiar, but …
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He was the ancient Greek god of medicine. The physi­cians
who revered him held that sickness could be cured using drugs and potions that
came from outside the body, since they believed that's where disease
originated. Now, of course, billion-dollar industries thrive by enhancing our
ar­senal of antibiotics.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I listened to this, wondering where he was headed. Then he
told me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There was, however, another school of healing at that
time, those who honored the daughter of Asklepios. She was Hygeia, their
goddess of health. The Hygeians believed that wellness originated from properly
governing your own body. For them, the greatest service of the physician was to
learn how we can work with our bodies. Their ideal was healing from within
rather than intervention from without.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Again he was studying me, as though trying to determine
whether I was going along with what he was saying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; he continued, &quot;the Hygeian
school more or less died out in the West. However, it lives on in other places.
For example, primitive peoples have no manufac­tured, synthetic drugs, so they
use natural herbs to enhance their own immune system and stay healthy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned to study the river, dropping into silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe I'm missing something,&quot; I declared finally.
His hypnotic voice had drawn me in, in spite of myself. &quot;How does this
relate to infertility?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned back and caught me with his shining eyes. They
seemed to be giving off heat of their own. &quot;Just as the body is intended
to heal itself, so is a woman's womb meant to create life. If she's childless,
the reason more often than not is that her body is out of harmony with itself.
What I do here is seek out each woman's unique energy flows and attempt to
restore them, using Eastern practices and Hygeian herbal therapies.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Does it always succeed?&quot; I abruptly wondered if
his techniques might work for me. Face it, Western medicine had completely
struck out. The problem was, the guy was just a little too smooth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not always. Some women's bodies are naturally
unresponsive, just as all organisms are subject to random . . . irregularities.
In those cases, I try to provide her a child by other means.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean adoption,&quot; I suggested.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;By whatever means seems appropriate,&quot; he replied
cryptically</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, there's something I'd like to understand. Last
week I met a woman who had adopted a baby boy through Children of Light. She
got him in three months. Such a thing is, ac­cording to what I can find out,
totally unheard of. So how did you manage that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stared down at the river. &quot;I thought I'd explained
that adoptions are not what we primarily do here. They're pro­vided only as a
last resort, in the few cases where my regimen of Hygeian therapies
fails.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But in those cases, where do you find—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As I've said before we talk about adoption, first we
need to satisfy ourselves that no other options are possible.&quot; Then his
eyes clicked into me. &quot;If you could come back next Sat­urday to begin your
tests and receive an orientation, I could give you an opinion about your
chances of bearing a child. It will require a thorough examination, but I can
usually tell with a good degree of certainty whether my program can help
someone or not. It's really important, though, that you stay at least . .
.&quot; He was staring at me. &quot;Mind if I do some­thing that might relieve
some of the symptoms of that cold?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He reached out and touched my temples with his long, lean
fingers. Then he placed his thumbs just above my eye­brows and pressed very
hard. After a long moment, he slowly moved the pressure down to the bridge of
my nose, then across under my eyes. Finally he put the heel of his hands just
above my ears and pressed again. After a couple of sec­onds he stepped away and
continued talking as though noth­ing had happened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;After I give you a full examination, we can discuss our
next step.&quot; With that he turned, ready to head back. &quot;Now if you'll
excuse me, I've got a lot of research data to organ­ize.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I guess he assumed his juggernaut of arcane medical the­ory
had rolled over me sufficiently that he could move on to other matters. I
sensed he really wanted me to come back, but he was careful to wind down our
mutual interview with a take-it-or-leave-it air. All the same, I felt intrigued
as we moved back through the gardens and then into the courtyard. A baby. Maybe
he could make it happen for Steve and me. In spite of myself, I felt a moment
of hope.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thank you for coming,&quot; he said by way of farewell,
just brushing my hand, then turned and disappeared through one of the ancient
wooden doors along the veranda, leaving me alone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, I thought, the calm voice and casual outfit are prob­ably
just part of his bedside manner, but you can't be near Alex Goddard and not
feel a definite sense of carefully con­trolled power. But is his power being
used for good?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This was the man whose staff was trying to deny me in­terviews
with mothers who'd adopted through Children of Light. And what about the
Hispanic hood with the gun? Did Alex Goddard send him? If not, his appearance
at Paula's building was one hell of a coincidence. So why should I trust . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when I noticed it. My lingering cold had mi­raculously
vanished, inflamed sinuses and all. I was breath­ing normally, and even my
chest felt cleared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God, I thought, what did he do? Hypnotize me? It was as
though a week's healing had passed through my body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I had an epiphany, a moment that galvanizes your resolve. I
had to do a documentary about this man, to find out what he was really up to.
He'd mentioned he had a place in Central America. Was that the source of his
special techniques, some kind of ancient Meso-American medical practices he'd
dis­covered?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He claimed he didn't want any publicity, but that's always
just an opening move. When somebody says that, what they really mean is they
don't want any bad publicity; they just want to have final say about what you
produce. There're ways to handle the problem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I liberated a brochure from the hall table on my way out,
thinking I would study it soon. Very closely. I had a nose for a good story,
and this one felt right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I got back to the car, Lou was nowhere to be seen. He'd
given me the impression he intended merely to sit there and doze while I went
inside, but now he was gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he appeared emerging from the forest of trees. Ac­tually,
there was another building opposite the stone drive that I hadn't noticed at
first. Hmmm, I thought, I wonder what that's all about. For some reason Alex
Goddard hadn't offered me a tour; he'd taken me for a stroll in the opposite
direction. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That was fast,&quot; Lou said settling into the car.
&quot;You get what you came for?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The answer to that was both yes and no. In a sense I'd gotten
considerably more than I bargained for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He wants me to come back,&quot; I said. &quot;And I
think I might do it. There's a lot more going on with Alex Goddard than you'd
know from just looking at this place. The trick is to stay in control when
you're around him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I tossed the brochure into Lou's lap as I started the engine.
He took it and immediately began looking through it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Lou, I knew, was a man always interested in facts and
figures. As we headed toward the Parkway he was pouring through the brochure
with intense interest, even as I tried to give him a brief reprise of Alex
Goddard's medical philoso­phy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It says here his patients come from all over the United
States and Europe,&quot; he noted, finally interrupting me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I found nothing odd in that, and went back to rambling on
about Quetzal Manor. Give the place its due, it was placid and tranquil and
smacked of the benign spirituality Goddard claimed to put so much stock in.
Still, I found it unsettling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>However, Lou, as usual, chose to see matters his own way.
He'd been studying the fine print at the back of the brochure, mumbling to
himself, and then he emitted a grunt of discov­ery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ah, here's what I was looking for,&quot; he declared.
&quot;You know, as a registered New York State adoption agency, this outfit has
got to divulge the number of babies they placed during their last yearly
reporting period.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;According to him, he only resorts to adoption if he
can't cure your infertility with his special mind-body regimen,&quot; I
reminded him. &quot;Your energy flows—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No shit,&quot; Lou observed, then went on. &quot;Well,
then I guess his mind-body, energy flows, whatever, bullshit must fail a lot.
Because last year the number was just under two hun­dred. So at sixty thou a
pop, like it says here, we're talking about twelve million smackeroos gross in
a year. Not a bad way to fail, huh?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I caught myself emitting a soft whistle as he read out the
number. There was definitely a lot more going on with Alex Goddard than met the
eye.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So what's he do with all that dough?&quot; Lou mused.
&quot;Bet­ter question still, where in the hell did he find two hundred fresh,
orphaned babies, all listed here as Caucasian? And get this: The ages reported
at final processing are all just a couple of months, give or take.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good questions, I thought. Maybe that's the reason he doesn't
want publicity; it sounds a little too commercial for a mind-body guru.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My other thought was, with so many babies somehow available,
why was Alex Goddard so reluctant to even discuss adoption with me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The answer, I was sure, lay in the fact he already knew more
about me than I knew about him. He knew I was mak­ing a film about adoption
(how did he come by that knowl­edge? I kept wondering) and he was concerned he might
be mentioned in it. I kept asking myself, why?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On our drive back down the Henry Hudson Parkway, I decided I
was definitely looking at a documentary in the making. I just had to decide
whether to do it with or without his cooperation.</span></p>

<h1><a name=bookmark8><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Chapter Six</span></a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='color:windowtext'>A</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>fter I dropped off Lou at his space
in Soho, where he was house sitting for an estate now in the courts, I decided
to head on home. The more I thought about Alex Goddard, the more I felt
frustrated and even a little angry that I'd com­pletely failed to find out any
of the things I'd wanted to learn about him. I replayed our interview in my
mind, got nowhere, and then decided to push away thoughts of Quetzal Manor for
a while and dwell on something else: Sarah, my film, anything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was Saturday, and unfortunately I had no plans for the
evening. Translation: no Steve. Back to where I started. How many million
stories in the naked city, and I was just so many million plus one. It's not a
jungle out there, it's a desert.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The truth was, after Steve took off, I hadn't really been
trying all that hard to pick myself up off the canvas and look around. Besides,
I didn't want some other guy, I wanted him. Added to that, I somehow felt that
when you're on the short countdown for forty, you shouldn't have to be going
out on blind dates, wondering whether that buttoned-down MBA sitting across
from you in some trendy Italian restaurant thinks you're a blimp (even though
you skipped lunch), tell­ing yourself he's presentable, doesn't seem like a
serial killer, has a job, only mentioned his mother once, and could qualify as
an acceptable life's mate. There's no spark, but he's prob­ably quite nice. You
wanly remember that old Barney's ad jingle, &quot;Select, don't settle,&quot;
but at this stage of life you're ready to admit you've flunked out in Love 101
and should just go with Like.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which was one of the reasons I missed Steve so deeply. He was
a lover, but he was also a best friend. And I was running low on those.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Every woman needs a best pal. After my former best, Betsy,
married Joel Aimes, Off-Broadway's latest contribu­tion to Dreamworks, and
moved to the Coast with him, I was noticing a lot of empty evenings. In the old
days, we could talk for hours. It was funny, since we were actually very
different. Betsy, who had forgotten more about clothes and makeup than most
women would ever know, hung around the garment-center showrooms and always came
away with samples of next season's couture, usually for a song. I envied her
that, since I usually just pretended not to care and pulled on another pair of
jeans every morning. But she shared my love of Asian music.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Anyway, now she was gone and I could tell we weren't working
hard enough at staying in touch. She and Joel had just moved to a new apartment
and I didn't even have her latest phone number. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which brought me back to Steve. I'd often wondered why we
were so alike, and I'd finally decided it was because we both started from the
same place spiritually. In his case, that place was a crummy childhood in New
Haven—which he didn't want to talk about much because, I gathered, it was as
lonely and deprived as my own, or at least as depressing. His father had owned
a small candy store and had wanted all his four children to become
&quot;professionals.&quot; The oldest had become a lawyer, the next a teacher.
When Steve's turn came, he was told he should become a doctor, or at the very
least, a dentist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Didn't happen. He'd managed four years of premed at</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Yale, but
then he rebelled, cashed in his med-school schol­arship, and went to Paris to
study photography. The result was he'd done what he wanted, been reasonably
successful at it, and his father had never forgiven him. I think he was still
striving for the old man's approval, even after all the years, but I doubted
he'd ever get it. Steve was a guy still coming to grips with things that
couldn't be changed, but in the meantime he lived in worlds that were as
different from his own past as he could find. He deliberately avoided mid­dle-class
comforts, and was never happier than when he was in some miserable speck on the
map where you couldn't drink the water. Whatever else it was, it wasn't New Ha­ven.
. . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thinking about him at that moment, I had an almost
irresistible desire to reach for my cell phone and call him. God, I missed him.
Did he miss me the same way? I wanted so much to hear him say it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I had a contact number for him in Belize City, an old,
Brit-like hotel called the Bellevue, where they still served high tea, but I
always seemed to call when he was out some­where in the rain forest, shooting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Do it. Don't be a wuss.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But then I got cold feet. Did I want him to think I was
chasing after him? I didn't want to sound needy . . . though that was exactly
what I felt like at the moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally I decided to just invent a phone conversation,
recreating one from times past, one where we both felt secure enough to be
flip. It was something I did more than I'd like to admit. Usually there'd be
eight rings at his Park Slope loft and then a harried voice. Yes. Steve, talk
to me. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yo. This is not a recording. I am just in a
transcendent plane. And if that's you, Murray, I'll have the contact sheets
there by six. Patience is a virtue.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Honey, it's me. Get out of the darkroom. Get a
life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, hi, baby.&quot; Finally tuning in. &quot;I'm working.
In a quest for unrelenting pictorial truth. But mainly I'm thinking of
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're printing, right? Darling, it's lunch hour. Don't
you feel guilty, working all the time?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The truth was, it was one of the reasons I respected him so
much. He even did his own contacts. His fervor matched my drive. It's what made
us perfect mates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've got tons of guilt. But I'm trying to get past it.
Be­come a full human person. Go back to the dawn of man. Paint my face and
dance in a thunderstorm.&quot; He'd pause, as though starting to get oriented.
&quot;Hey, look at the time. Christ. I've got a print shoot on Thirty-eighth
Street at three.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was chasing a bit of fashion work to supplement his
on-again, off-again magazine assignments.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Love,&quot; I said in my reverie, &quot;can you come
over tonight? I promise to make it worth your while. It involves a bubble bath,
champagne, roses everywhere, sensuous ragas on the CD. And maybe some crispy
oysters or something, sent in later on, just to keep us going.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I'd listen to the tone of his voice, knowing he'd say
yes but putting more stock in how he said it. Still, he always gave his lines a
good read.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then why don't we aim for about nine?&quot; I'd go on,
bliss­ful. &quot;That ought to give me a chance to get organized. And don't
bring anything except your luscious self.&quot; The fantasy was coming together
in my mind. Thinking back, I realized how much I missed him, all over again. .
. .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when the phone on the armrest beside me rang for
real. For a moment I was so startled I almost hit the brakes. Then I clicked it
on, my mind still buzzing about Steve, and also, in spite of my resolve, about
the curious runaround I'd just gotten from Alex Goddard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Listen, there was a message on my machine when I came</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>in. I've got
to go up to the hospital. Right now.&quot; Lou's voice was brimming with hope
and exuberance. &quot;They said Sarah was stirring. She's opened her eyes and
started talking. They said she's not making much sense, but . . . oh,
God.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's wonderful.&quot; I felt my heart expanding with
life. For some reason, I had a flash of memory of her climbing up into the
rickety little tree house—well, more like a plat­form—I'd helped her build in
my thirteenth summer, no boys invited to assist. A year later that part had
seemed terminally dumb. &quot;I'll meet you there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was almost home, but I screeched the car around and headed
east. Racing over, though, I tried not to wish for too much. I kept remembering
all the stages to a complete re­covery and telling myself that whatever had
happened, it was only the first step on a very long, very scary journey. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I hadn't realized how scary till I walked into the room. Lou,
who had gotten there just minutes before I did, was sitting by her side,
holding her hand, his gaze transfixed on her. She was propped up slightly in
her bed, two pillows fluffed behind her head, staring dreamily at the ceiling.
Three attentive middle-aged nurses were standing around the sides of her bed,
their eyes wide, as though Sarah were a ghost. I very quickly realized why. She
was spinning out a fantasy that could only come from a deranged mind. Had she
re­gained consciousness only to talk madness?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Lou, does she recognize you?&quot; I asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He just shook his head sadly, never taking his eyes off her
face. She was weaving in and out of reality, pausing, stut­tering, uncertain of
her incoherent brain. Once, when she'd fallen off a swing and got knocked out
for a brief moment, she came to talking nonsense. Now she seemed exactly the
same way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Lights ... so bright,&quot; she mumbled, starting up
again to recount what seemed to be a faraway fantasy, &quot;. . . like now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Why . . .
why are there lights here?&quot; Her lips were moving but her eyes were still
fixed in a stare. Then, with that last, odd question, her gaze began to dart
about the room, looking for someone who wasn't present. She settled on me for a
moment, and I felt a chill from her plaintive vulnerability. When I tried to
look back as benignly and lovingly as pos­sible, I couldn't help noticing how
drawn her cheeks were, doubtless from the constant IV feeding, and again my
heart went out. &quot;I'm scared,&quot; she went on, &quot;but—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm here, honey,&quot; Lou declared, bending over her,
his eyes pained. &quot;Do you know who I am?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The jade face . . . a mask,&quot; she babbled on, still
ignoring him. &quot;All the colors. It's so . . . so beautiful.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her hallucination didn't relate to anything I could under­stand.
She clearly was off in another world, like when she was a kid, weaving the
lights of the room now into some kind of dream. I touched Lou's shoulder and
asked permis­sion to turn off the overhead fluorescents, but he just shrugged
me off, his attention focused entirely on her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His eyes had grown puzzled, as though he wanted to be­lieve
she was returning to rationality but his common sense was telling him it wasn't
true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was having a different reaction. What she was saying was
random babblings, all right, but I was beginning to think she was reliving
something she had actually seen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>However, she wasn't through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I want to pray, but . . . the white tunnel . . . is
coming.&quot; She shuddered, then almost tried to smile. &quot;Take me . .
.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was gone, her eyelids fluttering uncontrollably.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Honey, talk to me,&quot; Lou pleaded. He was crying,
some­thing I'd never seen him do, something I was not even aware he was capable
of. What he really was trying to say was, &quot;Come back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It wasn't happening. She stared blankly at the ceiling for a
moment, then slowly closed her eyes, a shutter descending over her soul.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She'll be okay,&quot; I whispered to him, almost
believing it. Her brain had undergone a physical trauma, enough to cause a
coma, but some kind of mental trauma must have preceded it. Was she now trying
to exorcise that as part of her path to recovery?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The nurses in the room stirred, perhaps not sure what to do.
The overhead lights were still dazzlingly bright, and I moved to shut them off,
leaving only a night-light behind the bed. Perhaps the lights had brought her
awake, but I was convinced what she'd just gone through had tired her to the
point that she would not revive again that day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then one of the Caribbean nurses came over and placed her
hand on Lou's shoulder. She had an experienced face, full of self-confidence.
Something about her inspired trust.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I wouldn't let this upset you too much,&quot; she said,
a lovely lilt in her voice. &quot;What just happened may or may not mean
anything. When patients first come out of a coma, they can sometimes talk just
fine, and yet not make any sense. They ramble on about things they dreamed of
like they were real.&quot; Then she smiled. &quot;But it's a good first step.
She could wake up perfectly fine tomorrow. Just don't pay any attention to what
she says for a while. She's dreaming now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Lou grunted as though he believed her. I nodded in sym­pathy,
though no one seemed to notice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I also thought that although what Sarah had said was bi­zarre,
it sounded like something more than a dream. Or had she gone back to her
child-state where imaginary worlds were real for her?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then in the dim glare of her bed light, Lou took a wrinkled
blue booklet out of his inner pocket and stared at it. I had to stare at it a
moment before I realized it was a passport.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The American consulate in Merida, Mexico, sent it up to
26 Federal Plaza yesterday, because my name and office address are penciled on
the inside cover as an emergency contact. The police down there said somebody,
some gringo tourist fly-fishing way down on the Usumacinta River, near where
the Rio Tigre comes in from Guatemala, snagged this floating in a plastic bag.
He turned it in to the Mexican authorities there, and it ended up with our
people.&quot; He opened the passport and stared at it. &quot;The photo and ID
page is ripped out, but it's definitely Sarah's.&quot; He handed it over.
&quot;Guy I know downtown dropped it off last night. I'm not sure if it has
anything to tell us, but now, I was hoping it might help jog her memory.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I took it, the cover so waterlogged its color was almost
gone. However, it must have been kept dry in the plastic bag for at least some
of its trip from wherever, since much of the damage seemed recent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Lou shook his head staring wistfully at me. &quot;I still
don't know how she got down there. She was in California. Re­member that
postcard? If she'd come back East, she'd have got in touch. Wouldn't she?&quot;
His eyes pleaded for my agree­ment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I didn't know what to say, so I just shrugged. I wanted to be
sympathetic, but I refused to lie outright. He took my ambivalence as assent as
he pulled out the locket containing her picture, his talisman. He fingered it
for a moment, staring into space, and then he looked down and opened it, as if
seeing her high school picture, from a time when she was well, would somehow
ease his mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This whole thing doesn't sound like her,&quot; he went
on. &quot;Know what I think? She was being held down there against her
will.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My heart went out to him, and I reached over and took the
locket for a moment, feeling the strong &quot;SRC&quot; engraved on its
heart-shaped face. &quot;Lou, she's going to come out of it. And when she does,
she'll probably explain everything. She's going to be okay any day now, I've got
a hunch. A gut feeling.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I had a gut feeling, all right, but not that she was going to
be fine. My real fear was she was going to wake up a fantasy-bound child again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I handed the locket back. He'd seemed to turn anx­ious
without it. He took the silver heart and just stared down at it. In the silence
that settled over us, I decided to take a closer look at the passport. I
supposed Lou had already gone through it, but maybe he'd missed something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I flipped through the waterlogged pages, I came across a
smudgy imprint, caked with a thin layer of dried river clay, that was almost
too dim to be noticed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Lou, did you see this?&quot; I held it under the light
and beckoned him over. &quot;Can you read it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Probably not without my specs.&quot; He took it and
squinted helplessly. &quot;My eyes aren't getting any better.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I took it back and rubbed at the page, cleaning it. It was
hard to make out, but it looked like &quot;Delegacion de Migracion, Aeropuerto
Internacional, Guatemala, C.A.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think this is a Guatemalan tourist entry visa.&quot;
I raised the passport up to backlight the page. &quot;And see that faint bit
there in the center? That's probably her entry date. Written in by hand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He took it and squinted again. &quot;I can't read the damned
thing, but you're right. There's some numbers, or something, scribbled
in.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I took it and rubbed the page till I could read it clearly.
&quot;It's March eleventh. And it was last year.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hot damn, let me see that.&quot; He seized it back and
squinted for a long moment, lifting the page even closer to the light.
&quot;You're right.&quot; He held it for a second more, then turned to me.
&quot;This is finally the thing I needed. Now I'm damned well going to find out
what she was doing down there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How do you think you can do that?&quot; I just looked
at him, my mind not quite taking in what he'd just said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The airlines.&quot; He almost grinned. &quot;If they
can keep track of everybody's damned frequent-flyer miles for years and years,
they undoubtedly got flight manifests stored away somewhere too. So my first
step is to find out where she flew from.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But we don't know which—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Doesn't matter.&quot; He squinted again at the
passport. &quot;Now we know for sure she showed up at the airport in Guatemala
City on that date there. I know somebody down­town, smooth black guy named John
Williams, the FBI's best computer nerd, who could bend a rule for me and do a
little B&amp;E in cyberspace. He owes me a couple. So, if she was on a manifest
for a scheduled flight into Guatemala City that day, he'll find it. Then we'll
know where she left from, who else was on the plane.&quot; He tapped the
passport confidently with his forefinger. &quot;Maybe she was traveling with
some scumbag I ought to look up and get to know better.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, good luck.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In a way I was wondering if we weren't both now grasping for
a miracle: me half-hoping for a baby through some New Age process of
&quot;centering,&quot; Lou trying to reclaim Sarah from her mental abyss with
his gruff love. But then again, miracles have been known to happen.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>uetzal Manor could have the makings
of a great documentary,&quot; I was explaining to David Roth. &quot;I just need
some more information-gathering first, to get a better feeling for what Alex
Goddard is up to. So going back up there will be two birds with one stone. I'll
learn more about him, and he might even be able to tell me why I haven't been
able to get pregnant.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was frowning, his usual skeptical self. &quot;How
long—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's just for the weekend, or maybe a little . . . I'm
not sure exactly. I guess it depends on what kinds of tests he's going to run.
But the thing is, I have to do it now, while he and I are still clicking. An
'iron is hot' kind of moment. The only possible problem might be if I have to
push back my schedule for looping dialogue for <i>Baby Love </i>and then some­body's
out of town.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;You check with the sound studio to warn them
about possible rescheduling?&quot; He wanted to appear to be fuming. But since
he'd invited me down to his Tribeca loft at least once every three months, now
that I'd finally shown up, he also had a small gleam in his eye. What did that
mean?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, but I've already spotted most of the work print,
and I've made tentative dates for people to come in. In a week and a half.
Everything's still on schedule.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He leaned back on his white couch, as though trying to regroup.
It was Saturday morning and I'd already made the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>appointment
to see Alex Goddard. I was going. I probably should have run it by David first,
but damnit, it was my life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Truthfully, though, I'd been dreading telling him all week,
so to try and make him as congenial as possible, I'd arranged to see him at
home and relaxed. It seemed to be working, more or less.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, okay, sometimes I guess it's best to just go with
your gut,&quot; he said, beginning to calm down. He'd offered to whip up some
brunch when I first arrived, and now I was feeling sorry I'd turned him down. I
really did like him. But, alas, only as a friend. &quot;Before I cave in
totally, though, do me a favor and tell me some more about this . . . documen­tary?
What, exactly, makes you think it's—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Everything.&quot; Whereupon I laid on him the full
story of Carly and Paula, the children, and my encounter with Alex Goddard. The
only thing I left out was the story of the His­panic hood since I didn't think
he could handle it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This Quetzal Manor sounds like a funny operation,&quot;
he declared solemnly when I'd finished. &quot;I say the less you have to do
with a place like that, the better. Who knows what's going on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But, David that's what makes it so interesting. The
fact that it <i>is</i> a 'funny' operation. I really can see a documentary
here, after Baby Love is in the can. But I'll never have a chance if I don't
get to know this guy while I've got a good excuse. That's how my business
works.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So you're going to go back up there and . . . Is this
like going undercover or something?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well . . .&quot; What was I going to say? I was
actually half beginning to believe that Alex Goddard might be able to figure
out why Steve and I couldn't conceive. It was certainly worth a few days of my
life, documentary or no documentary. &quot;Look, I really want to find out
what's going on. For a lot of reasons.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He sighed and sipped at his coffee.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgy, this has got to be quick. Nicky Russo called
again. The thing I've learned about loan sharks, they keep your books better
than you do. He knows exactly how much money we've got left and how long we can
last. He's licking his chops, getting ready to eat us whole.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What did you tell him?&quot; The very thought of Nicky
gave me a chill. If we missed so much as a week on the juice, he'd have the
legal right to just seize my negative. When you're desperate, you sign those
kinds of loans.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I told him something I haven't even told you yet.&quot;
He smiled a wicked grin. &quot;I know you've been schmoozing Life­time about a
cable deal, but before we put the ink to that, I want to finish some new talks
I've started with Orion, their distribution people.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I think I stopped breathing for a second or two. Was there a
chance for a theatrical release for <i>Baby Love</i>, not just a cable deal?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When . . . You've actually met with them? How—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Late yesterday.&quot; He was still grinning. &quot;I
ran into Jerry Reiner at Morton's and pitched the picture. Actually, I heard he
was in town, so I wore a tie and ambushed him at lunch. He wants to see a rough
cut as soon as we've got something ready.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;David, you're an angel.&quot; I was ecstatic. It was
more than I'd dared hope for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So stay focused, for chrissake, and finish your
picture. We're this close to saving our collective asses, so don't blow it.
I've gone over all the schedules pretty carefully, and I'd guess we can spare a
day or two, but if you drag this out, I'm going to read you your contract, the
fine print about due diligence, and then finish up the final cut myself. I mean
it. Don't make me do that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't you even think about that.&quot; Never!
&quot;This is my picture.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just business. If it's a choice between doing what I
gotta do, or having Nicky Russo chew me a new asshole and be­come the silent
partner in Applecore, guess what it's gonna be.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;David, you know I would never let that happen.&quot; I
walked over and gave him the sweetest hug I knew how, still filled with joy.
&quot;And thanks so much for trying to get us a theat­rical. You don't know how
much that means to me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, don't try the charm bit on me. I'm serious. I'll
cut you a weekend's slack, but then it's back to the salt mines. Either this
picture's in the can inside of six weeks, or we're both going to be looking for
new employment. So go the hell up there, do whatever it is you're going to do,
and then get this damned picture finished. There'll be plenty of time after
that to worry about our next project. With luck we might even have the money
for it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With that ultimatum still ringing in my ears, I took my leave
of David Roth and headed north, up the Henry Hud­son Parkway. My life was getting
too roller-coaster for words. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I drove, I tried not to dwell on the practical aspects of
what was coming. It was hard to imagine what tests Alex Goddard could perform
that hadn't already been done by Hannah Klein. Just thinking back over that
dismal sequence made me feel baby-despondent all over again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I first mentioned I was thinking about trying to get
pregnant, she looked me over, perhaps mentally calculating my age and my
prospects, and then made a light suggestion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why don't I give you a prescription for Clomid.
Clomiphene citrate enhances ovulation, and it might be a good idea in your
case. You're still young, Morgan, but you're no longer in the first blush of
youth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I took it for six months, but nothing happened. That was the
beginning of my pregnancy depression.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By that time, she'd decided I definitely had a problem, so
she began what she called an &quot;infertility workup.&quot; The main thing was
to check my Fallopian tubes for blockages and look for ovulatory abnormalities.
But everything turned out to be fine. Depression City.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;maybe your body just <i>thinks</i>
you've released an ovum. We need to do an ultrasound scan to make doubly sure
an ovarian follicle has ruptured when it's sched­uled to and dropped an
egg.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It turned out, however, that all those hormonal stop-and-go
signals were working just fine. In the meantime, Steve and I were doing it like
bunnies and still no pregnancy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay, she then declared, the problem may be with your
Fallopian tubes after all. Time to test for abnormalities. &quot;This is not
going to be fun. First we have to dilate your cervix, after which we inject a
dye and follow it with X-rays as it moves through the uterus and is ejected out
of your Fallopian tubes. We'll know right away if there's any kind of blockage.
If there is something, we can go in and fix it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sort of check out my pipes,&quot; I said, trying to
come to grips with the procedure. I was increasingly sinking into de­spondency.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She did it all, and for a while she suspected there might be
some kind of anatomical problem. Which brought us to the next escalation of
invasiveness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We've got to go in and take a close-up look at every­thing,&quot;
she said. &quot;It's a procedure called laparoscopy. I'll have to make a small
incision near your navel and insert a tiny optical device. In your case, I want
to combine it with what's called a hysteroscopy, which will allow me to see
directly inside your uterus for polyps and fibroids.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But again everything looked fine. I began to wonder what had
happened to everybody's mother's warning you could get pregnant just letting
some pimply guy put his hand in your pants.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Prior to all this, I should add, Steve had provided samples
of sperm to be tested for number and vigor. (Both were just fine.) Then, toward
the end of all the indignities, he actually paid to have some kind of test
performed involving a hamster egg, to see if his sperm was lively enough to
penetrate it. No wonder he finally went over the edge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now I was reduced to Alex Goddard. I'd brought a com­plete
set of my medical test records, as Ramala had requested on the phone. I'd also
brought a deep curiosity about what exactly he could do that hadn't already
been done. I further wondered how I was going to talk Steve into coming back
long enough to share in the project. As I motored up the driveway to Quetzal
Manor, I told myself he loved me still, wanted a baby as much as I did . . .
Well, let me be safe and say almost as much. The problem was, he was so
demoralized about the whole thing. And then what? What if nothing hap­pened?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I started to park my car where I had the last time, then
noticed the place actually had a parking lot. It was located off to the left
side of the driveway, near the second, modern building, and was more or less
hidden in amongst the trees. The lot was filled with a lot of late-model but
inexpensive cars, basic working-girl transportation, and it seemed a better bet
for long-term parking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The front lobby, which had been empty the first time I was
there, was now a minimalist reception area, a long metal desk rolled in from
somewhere. I had the odd feeling it was there just for me. The woman behind the
desk introduced herself as Ramala, the same person I'd talked to twice on the
phone. She looked to be about my age, with long dark hair and quick Asian eyes,
punctuated by a professional smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She knew my name, used it the minute she saw me, and then
abruptly handed me a twenty-page &quot;application&quot; to complete.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's not just a formality,&quot; she explained,
businesslike and earnest. &quot;Dr. Goddard feels it's essential that he come
to know you as a person. He'll read this carefully, believe me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She ushered me to a chair that had a retractable table for
writing, then gave me a ballpoint pen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The document turned out to be the most prying, nosy thing I'd
ever filled out. The pages demanded what amounted to a mini life history. One
of the things that struck me as most strange was the part asking for a ten-year
employment and residential history. If you've moved around as much as I have,
worked freelance a lot, you'll understand how difficult it can be to
reconstruct all those dates and places, but I did my best.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There were, of course, plenty of health questions too. One
page even asked whether there was anything out of the or­dinary about my own
birth: Was the delivery difficult, a ce­sarean, a breach baby? It was, as
noted, a life history.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why does he need all this information?&quot; I asked
finally, feeling the onset of carpal tunnel syndrome in my right wrist. &quot;I
brought all my medical records.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ramala gave me a kindly smile, full of sympathy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He must know you as a person. Then everything is pos­sible.
When I came here, I had given up on ever having a child, but I surrendered
myself to him and now my husband and I have twin boys, three years old. That's
why I stayed to help him. His program can work miracles, but you must give him
your trust.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, I thought, I might as well go with the flow and see
where it leads.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I'd finished the form, she took it back, along with the
pen, then ushered me into the wide central courtyard where I'd met Alex Goddard
the first time. He was nowhere to be seen, but in the bright late-morning
sunshine there was a line of about twenty women, from late twenties to early
forties, all dressed in white pajama-like outfits of the kind you see in judo
classes, doing coordinated, slow-motion Tai Chi-like exercises. They were
intent, their eyes fixed on the fringes of infinity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>These must be some of his acolytes, I thought, the ones I
heard in their nuns' cells the first time I was here. What on earth does all
this orientalism have to do with fertility? I then found myself wondering. I've
studied the Far East enough to do &quot;penetrating&quot; documentaries about
it, and I still can't get pregnant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I took one look at them—none of them looked at me—and my
heart went out. They were so sincere, so sure of what they were doing. For
somebody who's always questioning everything, like me, it was touching, and
maybe a little daunt­ing too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without a word, Ramala led me past them and on to an entryway
at the far end of the courtyard, past the giant Danc­ing Shiva. The door was
huge and ornate, decorated with beaten-copper filigree—much like one I'd seen
in a Mogul palace in Northern India. Definitely awe-inspiring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She pushed open the door without ceremony and there he was,
dressed in white and looking for all the world like the miracle worker he
claimed to be. He seemed to be meditating in his chair, but the moment I
entered, his deep eyes snapped open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did you bring your records?&quot; he asked, not getting
up. While I was producing them from my briefcase, Ramala dis­creetly
disappeared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Please have a seat.&quot; He gestured me toward a wide
chair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>The room was
a sterile baby blue, nothing to see. No diplo­mas, no photos, nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Except for another, smaller bronze statue of the Dancing
Shiva, poised on a silver-inlaid table. I also noticed that his own flowing
hair seemed to match that of the bronze figure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes, I thought, I was right. That's who he thinks he is. And
he has complete power over the people around him. How many chances do you get
to do a documentary about somebody like this? I should have brought a Betacam
for some video.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He studied my test records as a jeweler might examine a
diamond, his serious eyes boring in as he flipped through the pages. The rest of
his face, however, betrayed no particu­lar interest. I finally felt compelled
to break the awkward silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you can see, I've had every test known to science.
And none of them found anything wrong.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He just nodded, saying nothing, and kept on reading.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After a long, awkward silence, I decided to try and open
things up a bit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell me, do you have any children of your own?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The question seemed to be one he didn't get asked too often,
because he stopped cold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All those who come here are my children,&quot; he
replied, putting aside my records, dismissively finished with them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well&quot;—I pointed to them—&quot;what do you
think?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I haven't examined you yet,&quot; he said, looking up
and smiling, indeed beaming with confidence. &quot;Nothing in those records
tells me anything about what may be your problem. I look for different things
than do most physicians.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He fiddled with something beneath his desk, and the room was
abruptly filled with the sound of a hypnotic drone. Per­haps its frequency
matched one in my brain, because I instantly felt relaxed and full of hope.
Much better than Muzak. Then he rose and came over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Is he going to do my exam right here? I wondered. Where's all
the ob/gyn paraphernalia? The humiliating stirrups?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Standing in front of me, he gently placed his hands on my
heart, then bent over and seemed to be listening to my chest. His touch was
warm, then cold, then warm, but the overall effect was to send a sense of
well-being through my entire body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're not breathing normally,&quot; he said after a
moment of unnerving silence. &quot;I feel no harmony.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How did he know that? But he was right. I felt the way I had
the first time I tried to sit in Zen meditation in Kyoto. As then, my body was
relaxing but my wayward brain was still coursing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll try,&quot; I said, attempting to go along. What I
really was feeling was the overwhelming sense of his presence, drawing me to
him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next he moved around behind me and cradled my head in his
hands, placing his long fingertips on my forehead, sort of the same way he'd
done when I was standing with him on the windy heath, nursing a killer cold.
All the while, the drone seemed to be increasing to a piercing, overwhelming
volume, as though a powerful electrical force were growing in the room, sending
me into an alpha state of relaxation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you doing? Is this how you do an exam
for—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The medical tests you had showed there's nothing wrong
with your uterus or your Fallopian tubes, nothing that should inhibit
conception. There's no need to pursue that any further. But the mind and the
body are a single entity that must be harmonized, must work as one. Although
each individual has different energy flows, I think my regimen here could be
very helpful to you. Already I can tell your problem is a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>self-inflicted
trauma that has negated the natural condition wherein your mind and body work
in unison.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What 'trauma'?&quot; I asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He didn't answer the question. Instead he began massag­ing my
temples.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Breathe deeply. And do it slowly, very slowly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I did, I felt a kind of dizziness gradually coming over
me, the hypnotic drone seeming to take over my conscious­ness. Instead of
growing slower, my breathing was actually becoming more rapid, as though I'd
started to hyperventilate. But I no longer had any control over it. My
autonomic ner­vous system had been handed over to him, as dizziness and a sense
of disorientation settled over me. The room around me began to swirl, and I
felt my conscious mind, my will, slipping out of my grasp. It was the very
thing I'd vowed not to let happen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The same thing had occurred once before, after I broke my
collarbone in the Pacific surf that slammed a Mexican beach south of Puerto
Villarta. When a kindly Mexican doc­tor was later binding on a harness to
immobilize my shoulder, the pain was such that I momentarily passed out while
sitting on a stool in his office. I didn't fall over or collapse; it just
seemed as though my mind, fleeing the incredible pain, drifted away in a haze
of sensation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now the pastel blue walls of the room slowly faded to white,
and then I was somewhere else, a universe away, sur­rounded by blank
nothingness. I tried to focus on the bronze Shiva directly across, but the ring
of fire around him had become actual flames. The only reality left was the
powerful touch of Alex Goddard's hands and a drone that could have been the
music of the spheres.</span></p>

<h2><a name=bookmark10>Chapter Eight</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='color:windowtext'>S</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>ometime thereafter, in a reverie, I
felt myself in a magical forest whose lush vines reminded me of Kerala in
India. It was a verdant, hazy paradise, another Eden. A child was with me, a
child of my own, and I felt jubilation. I watched the child as she grew and
became a resplendent orchid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But with childbearing came pain, and I seemed to be feel­ing
that pain as I took up the flower and held it, joy flowing through me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Alex Goddard drifted into my dream, still all in white,
and he was gentle and caring as he again moved his hands over me, leaving
numbness in their wake. I thought I heard his voice talking of the miracle that
he would make for me. A miracle baby, a beautiful flower of a child. I asked
him how such a thing would happen. A miracle, he whispered back. It will be a
miracle, just for you. When he said it, the orchid turned into the silver face
of a cat, a vaguely familiar image, smiling benignly, then transmuted back into
a blos­som.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he drifted out of my dream much as he had come, a wisp
of white, leaving me holding the gorgeous flower against my breasts, which had
begun to swell and spill out milk the color of gold. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A wet coolness washed across my face, and—as I faintly heard
the sounds of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, Glenn Gould's piano notes crisp and
clear—I opened my eyes to</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>see Ramala
massaging my brow with a damp cloth. She smiled kindly and lovingly as she saw
my eyes open, then widen with astonishment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, how're you doing? Don't be alarmed. He's taking
great care of you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What. . . where am I?&quot; I lifted my head off the
pillow and tried to look around. I half expected Steve to be there, but of
course he wasn't.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're here. At Quetzal Manor.&quot; She reached and
did something and the music slowly faded away. &quot;Don't worry. You'll be
fine. I think the doctor was trying to release your Chi, and when he did it was
too strong for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What day is it?&quot; I felt completely disoriented my
bear­ings gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sunday. It's Sunday morning.&quot; She reached and
touched my brow as though giving me a blessing. Like, it's okay, really.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment, Alex Goddard strolled in, dressed again in
white.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just as in the dream, I thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So, how's the patient?&quot; He walked over—eyes benign
and caring—and lifted my wrist, absently taking my pulse while he inserted a
digital thermometer in my ear. For a flash­back moment he merged into, then
emerged from, my dream. &quot;You're looking fine. I have to say, though, you
had quite a time yesterday.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All I remember is passing out in your office,&quot; I
mumbled glancing around at the gray plastic thermometer. And that strange
dream, you telling me I would have a miracle baby.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You had an unusual reaction,&quot; he went on.
&quot;You remem­ber I spoke to you about mind-body harmony. You see what can
happen when I redirect the flows of energy, Chi, from your body to your
mind.&quot; He smiled and settled my wrist back onto the bed. &quot;Don't
worry. I have a lot of hope for you. You're going to do fine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked satisfied as he consulted the thermometer, then
jotted down my temperature on a chart. He's already started a medical record, I
thought. Why?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm . . . I'm wondering if this really is working
out,&quot; I said. It was dawning on me that I was getting into Alex God­dard's
world a lot deeper and a lot faster than I'd expected. I'd come planning to be
an observer and now I was the one being observed. That was exactly not how I'd
intended it. Maybe, I thought, if I back off and make a new run, I can keep us
on equal footing. &quot;Perhaps I ought to just go back to the city for a few
days and—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd assumed you came to begin the program.&quot; He
looked at me, a quick sadness flooding his eyes. &quot;You struck me as a
person who would follow through.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I need to think this over&quot; I really feel terrible,
I thought, trying to rise up. What did he do to me? &quot;Maybe I'm just not
right for your 'program'?&quot; The idea of a documentary had momentarily
retreated far into the depths of my mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;On the contrary.&quot; He smiled. &quot;We've shown
that you're very responsive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe that's it. Maybe I'm too responsive.&quot; I rose
and slipped my feet off the bed. The motion brought a piercing pain in my
abdomen. &quot;OUCH! What's . . .&quot; I felt my pelvis, only to find it was 
very sensitive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Pulling aside my bed shift, I gazed in disbelief at my lower
abdomen. There were red spots just above my pale blue pant­ies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alex Goddard modestly averted his eyes. &quot;I didn't want
to say anything,&quot; he explained to the wall above my head, &quot;but you
were in pretty delicate shape there for a while. Mild convulsions, and I think
your digestive system had gone into shock. The stomach is a center of energy,
because it's constantly active. So I gave you some shots of muscle relaxant.
Nothing serious. It's an unusual treatment, but I've found it works. It . . .
modulates the energy flows. I also took a blood sample for some tests, but the
results were all normal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He then asked me about my menstrual cycle, exact days, saying
he wanted to make sure it wasn't just routine cramps. &quot;The seizure you had
passed almost as soon as it came, but you might actually have been
hallucinating a bit. You had a slight fever all night.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well . . .&quot; Something like that had happened to me
years ago in rural Japan, when I stupidly ate some unwashed greens and my
stomach went into shock. At one point a local doctor, Chinese, was trying
acupuncture, which also left me sore.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nothing to be worried about,&quot; he continued.
&quot;But if you're the least bit concerned, maybe we ought to do a quick
sonogram, take a sound picture. Ease your mind that every­thing's okay.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That doesn't really seem necessary,&quot; I said. For a
clinic specializing in &quot;energy flows&quot; and &quot;mind-body&quot;
programs, there was a lot of modern equipment. Odd.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Won't do a bit of harm.&quot; He nodded at Ramala, who
also seemed to think it was a good idea. &quot;Come on, help me walk her down
to the lab.&quot; He turned back. &quot;It's totally noninva­sive. You'll see
for yourself that you're fine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before I could protest, I found myself walking, with some
dizziness, down the hallway. This part of Quetzal Manor, which I had not seen
before, was a sterile, high-tech clinic. I realized I was in a different
building from the old convent, probably the new one I'd noticed across the
parking lot, the one he hadn't bothered to mention that first day. But all I
could focus on were the blue walls and the new white tiles of the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The sonogram was as he described it, quick and noninvasive.
He rubbed the ultrasound wand over my abdomen, watching the picture on a CRT
screen, which showed my insides, a jumble of organs that he seemed to find
extremely informative.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look.&quot; He pointed. &quot;Those lines there are
your Fallopian tubes, and that's your uterus.&quot; He pushed a button to
record a digital image. &quot;Seems like whatever was upsetting your stomach is
gone. Obviously nothing's wrong here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good,&quot; I said, &quot;because I really need to take
a few days and think this over.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You should stay,&quot; he said, reaching to touch my
hand. &quot;I think the worst is well behind us. From here on, we can work
together. In fact, what I actually wish you would do is come with me to my
clinic in Central America. It's truly a place of miracles.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I assumed he was referring to the &quot;special place&quot;
he'd mentioned during our first interview. If Quetzal Manor was on the exotic
side, I thought, what must that place be like? A documentary that took in the
totality of who and what he was could be—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In fact,&quot; he went on, &quot;I just learned I have
to be going there later today. A quick trip to catch up on some things. So this
would be an ideal time for you to come. We could go together.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, I thought, I'd love to see what else he's up to, but
this whole scene is getting out of control. When I first met Alex Goddard, we
had a power balance, but now he's defi­nitely calling the shots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't think I'm ready for that kind of commitment
yet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you wish.&quot; He smiled with understanding.
&quot;But let me just say this. It's not going to be easy, but nothing I've
seen so far suggests there's any physical reason why you can't have a child. We
just need to get you in touch with the energy centers in your body. Rightness
flows from that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You really think so?&quot; In spite of myself I felt my
hopes rising, even though I had definite mixed feelings about his kind of
&quot;holistic&quot; medicine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm virtually certain. But whether you want to continue
with the program or not is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, maybe when I'm feeling better we can talk some
more about it.&quot; I definitely needed to reconsider my game plan. &quot;For
now, I think I'd better just get my things and—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you wish.&quot; He sighed. &quot;Your clothes are in
your room. There's a closet in the corner by the window.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I shot a glance at him. &quot;Does my Blue Cross cover
this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>“On the house.&quot; A dismissive wave of his hand, and an­other
kindly smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was still feeling shaky as I moved back down the vacant
hallway, but I refused to let either of them help me. Instead I left him to
oversee Ramala as she shut down the equipment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Oddly, the place still seemed vacant except for me, though
there was a large white door that appeared to lead to another wing. What was in
there? I wondered. The questions kept piling up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It soon turned out I was wrong about the clinic being empty.
When I reached the door to the room where I'd been, I thought I heard a
shuffling sound inside. I pushed it open gingerly and saw the room was dark. It
hadn't been when I left. The shuffling noise—I realized it was somebody closing
the Venetian blinds—immediately stopped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I began feeling along the wall for the light switch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Please leave it off,&quot; said a spacey female voice.
&quot;It's nice when it's dark.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As my eyes became accustomed to the eerie half-light, I
finally made out a figure. It was a short woman, childlike but probably
mid-twenties.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you doing in here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I just wanted to, like, be with you.&quot; She'd done
her dark hair in multiple braids, with a red glass bead at the end of each.
&quot;You're special. We all know it. That's why he brought you over here, to
this building. To be near them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean, 'special'?&quot; I asked, heading for
the closet and my black jeans. Then I wondered. Near who?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now she was reaching into a fanny pack she had around her
waist and taking out a baggie filled with plastic vials. &quot;These are herbs
I've started growing here. I picked them for you. If you'll—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Slow down,&quot; I said, lifting my jeans off the
hanger and starting to struggle into them. Finally I took the baggie, moved to
the window, and tilted up the blind. Inside it were clear plastic medicine bottles
containing various gray and green powders and flakes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God, what's she trying to give me? And why?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Listen,&quot; she went on, insistent. &quot;Take those.
Put two teaspoons of each in water you've boiled and drink it. Every day for a
week. They'll make you strong. Then you'll be—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, I'm going to be just fine, really.&quot; I set
them aside and studied her, still a ghostlike figure in the semi dark. There
was a wildness in her eyes that was very disturbing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment, Alex Goddard appeared in the doorway. He
clicked on the light, looking puzzled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Couldn't find the switch?&quot; Then he glanced around.
&quot;Tara, did you get lost? I thought you were doing your medi­tation. It's
Sunday. Afterwards, though, you can weed the north herb boxes if you
want.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She nodded silently, then grabbed the baggie and glided out,
her brown eyes filled with both reverence and what seemed like fear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who was that?&quot; I asked, staring after her, feeling
unset­tled by the whole experience. &quot;She seemed pretty intense.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tara's been pretty intense for some time, perhaps for
much of her life,&quot; he declared with a note of sadness as he closed the
door behind her. &quot;I've not been able to do anything for her, but I've let
her stay on here since she has nowhere else to go. She loves the gardens, so
I've let her work out there. It seems to improve her self-esteem, a kind of
benign therapy, her own natural path toward centering.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, I thought, she certainly could use some
&quot;centering.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, Dr. Goddard, let me get my things, and then I've
got to be going. I can't start on anything right now. Not the way I'm feeling.
And visiting your other clinic is completely out of the question, at least for
the moment.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have great hopes for you,&quot; he said again,
placing a gentle hand on my shoulder. &quot;I'm sorry we can't begin to work
together immediately. But do promise me you'll recon­sider and come back
soon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe when I'm feeling better.&quot; Keep the option
open, I told myself. For a lot of reasons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In that case, Ramala can show you out. I've arranged
for her to give you some herbal extracts from the rain forest that could well
start you on the road to motherhood. Whether you decide to come back or not, I
know they'll help you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And he was gone, a wisp of white moving out the doorway. It
was only then that I realized I'd again been too preoccupied to ask him about
Kevin and Rachel, the beautiful siblings born six months apart. Instead all I
had left was a memory of those penetrating eyes. And the power, the absolute
power.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h1><a name=bookmark11><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Chapter Nine</span></a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='color:windowtext'>A</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>fter giving me a small bag with two
bottles, Ramala led me out, and I discovered I really <i>had </i>been in a
different building, the one situated across the long-term parking lot and all
but hidden in the trees. It was new, one-story, and probably larger than it
appeared from the front. Again I won­dered what went on in there, since it
seemed so empty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Check it out and soon, I told myself as I slipped my key into
the ignition. You've got to find out a lot more about this place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On the drive back to the city, my main thought was that I'd
lost a day of my life. It'd just sort of slipped away. But that wasn't all. I
also began to meditate on the fact that Alex Goddard could have an immense
influence over my body (or was it my mind?) with a simple touch. Give him his
due, he could definitely make things happen. First my cold and now this.
Perhaps he could give me a child, if I got &quot;centered,&quot; whatever that
meant. But why should I trust him?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And there was another problem. For a baby I'd need Steve, the
man I loved, the guy who'd promised to be with me through thick and thin. Did
he really mean it? He'd have to fly in, which meant a serious piece of change
for the airfare. Finally, could he face another chance of failure? My spirits
sank at the prospect of having to ask him. Were we both just going to be
humiliated one more time?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd made his home base in Belize, that little Rhode Island
of a country abutting big, bad Guatemala. He liked the fact they used English,
more or less, as the official language and they hadn't gotten around to murdering
two hundred thou­sand Maya, the way Guatemala had. In a romantic moment, I'd
programmed his Belize hotel number into the memory of my cell phone—the
telephones down there are amazingly good, maybe the Brit legacy—though I'd
never actually tried it. (I'd called him from home about half a dozen times,
but he was rarely there.) Well, I thought, the time has come. Maybe it was the
sensual feelings released by all the Chi flowing around, but for some reason I
found myself feeling very lonely. He hadn't called recently, though. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It took ten rings, but eventually the hotel answered. A
moment later, they were trying his room. I guess I was half afraid a woman
might pick up, but it was him and there were no hushed tones or cryptic
monosyllables. I heaved a minor sigh of reassurance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Baby, I can't believe it's you,&quot; he declared.
&quot;I've actually been trying to reach you for a day now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You finally get around to missing me?&quot; It was so
good to hear his voice, full of life and energy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All the time. Never didn't. You've just got to
understand it's crazy down here. All last week I was in Honduras, hag­gling
over permits. Don't ask.&quot; He paused. &quot;So, when are you coming down?
They've got a national park here that's a pure chunk of rain forest, jaguars
everywhere.&quot; He laughed. &quot;But forget that. If you come down, we'll
never get out of the hotel. Just room service all day.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No immediate plans,&quot; I said, immediately wondering
how I could swing it. &quot;But you never know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I wasn't entirely sure how to approach Steve anymore. There
was something about the abrupt way he took off that left things up in the air.
A tiny sliver of uneasiness was slipping into my head-over-heels trust, the
camel's nose under the tent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;First the good news,&quot; I declared. &quot;David's
talking to Orion about a theatrical release for <i>Baby Love</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Steve knew how deeply I longed for a theatrical—it
would be my first—and he enthused appropriately. But he also knew I wouldn't
call him early Sunday morning just to tell him that. There was only one other
thing that would inspire such an unsocialized act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Uh, should I be asking how the other baby project is
going?&quot; he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For a moment I wasn't sure what to say, since I didn't really
even know myself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Still a work in progress,&quot; I said finally. Then;
&quot;Honey, I've just been to see a doctor who's . . . well, he's a little
unconventional. And nervous-making. But everything else has failed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whereupon I gave him a quick, cell-phone summary of what I'd
just been through at Quetzal Manor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So are you going to go back eventually?&quot; He
sounded uneasy. &quot;For the full 'program'?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had a way of zeroing in on essentials. The truth was, my
baby hopes and my sense of self-preservation were at war with each other. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgy, are you there?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm here. And I guess the answer is, I'm still trying
to decide. Like I said, he's into Eastern medicine and Native American . . .
I'm not sure what. But if I need you, are you still in the project?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Darlin', don't play dumb. You know exactly what I mean.
Could you come back if I needed you? Really needed you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was a long pause, wherein the milliseconds dragged by
like hours. Trees were gliding past, throwing shadows on</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>my
windshield, and I still felt vaguely dizzy. I also had a residual ache in my
abdomen where Alex Goddard had given me those damned muscle-relaxant shots. Why
was I even considering going back?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally: &quot;You're not making this easy, you know. Down
here, without our . . . project on the front burner every day, I've been
reassessing . . . well, a lot of things. If we had a baby, it would turn our
lives upside down. I mean, it's not like we just bought a sheepdog and chipped
in on the groom­ing. This is a human life we're talking about. Are we really
prepared to do justice to a child?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There it was. I didn't know whether I wanted to burst into
tears, or strangle the man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, why don't you just think about it,&quot; I told
him. &quot;This doesn't sound like a conversation we should be having on a cell
phone.&quot; Blast him. &quot;If that's the way you feel now, then I might just
have a baby on my own.&quot; How, I wasn't sure. I'd been so certain we were a
couple, I'd not given it any real thought. &quot;Or then again, I might just go
ahead and adopt, with or without you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, I'm not saying I won't do it. I'm just saying
it's not a trivial thing.&quot; He paused. &quot;So where does that leave
us?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Translation: second thoughts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know where that leaves us, Steve. In the shit,
I guess. But I'd still like to know if I can count on you, or am I going to
have to go to a sperm bank or something?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jesus. Let me think about this, okay? Do I have to
answer you now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No. But I'm not going to wait forever either.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right.&quot; Then he paused. &quot;Morgy, I miss
you. I really do. I just need some time to think about our next step. Are you
sure you're okay? You sound a little out of it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thanks for asking. I've just got a lot on my
mind.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Turmoil, dismay, and hope, all tossed together, that was what
I had on my mind. I really didn't need mixed signals from Steve at the moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A few more awkward pleasantries and I clicked off the phone,
wiped the streaks from my cheeks, and abruptly sensed Alex Goddard's face
floating through my psyche. Why was that? Then I looked down at the bottles on
the seat beside me, the &quot;herbal extracts&quot; Ramala had given me on the
way out. What, I wondered, should I do about them? For that matter, what were
they anyway? And what did they have to do with &quot;centering&quot;? If I
started on his homeopathic treat­ments, what would I be getting into? Then I
lectured myself: Never take something when you don't know what it is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hannah Klein. That's who I should ask.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was so focused, I pushed the number I had stored for her in
my phone memory before I remembered it was Sunday. Instead of getting her
office, I got an answering service.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you want to leave the doctor a message?&quot; a
south­ern-sounding voice enquired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without thinking, I heard myself declaring, &quot;No, this is
an emergency.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What am I saying? I asked myself. But before I could take it
back, Hannah was on the line.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I know how intruded on I feel when an actor calls me at home
on Sunday to bitch. Better make this good, I told my­self.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was at an infertility clinic yesterday and passed
out,&quot; I began. &quot;And now I have some herbs to take, but I'm . . .
well, I'm not sure about them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What 'clinic'?&quot; she asked. There was no reprimand
for calling her on Sunday morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I told her about Alex Goddard, she said little, but she
did not sound impressed. Looming there between us like the dead elephant on the
living room floor was the fact that she'd specifically warned me not to go near
him. And after what had just happened, there was a good case she might be
right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Can I buy you brunch?&quot; I finally asked, hoping to
lure her back onto my case. &quot;I'd really like to show you these herbs he gave
me and get your opinion.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was just headed out to Zabar's to get
something,&quot; she said, somewhat icily. Well, I suppose she thought she had
good reason. &quot;I'll get some bagels and meet you at my of­fice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sunday traffic on upper Broadway was light, and I lucked out
and found a parking space roughly two blocks from her building. It was one of
the low-overhead &quot;professional&quot; types with a single small elevator
and no doorman. When I got there, the lobby was empty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her suite was on the third floor, and I rang the bell before
I realized the door was open. She was back in her office, behind the reception
area, taking off her coat, when I marched in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While she was unwrapping her sesame bagels, smoked sturgeon,
and cream cheese with chives, she got an earful. My feeling was I'd better talk
fast, and I did. I told her ev­erything I could think of about what had
happened to me at Quetzal Manor. I didn't expect her to make sense of it from
my secondhand account, but I wanted to set the background for my next move.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When I was leaving, his assistant gave me these two
bottles of gel-caps. She said they're special herbal extracts he makes from
plants in the rain forest. Do you think I ought to take them?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I suspected I already knew the answer. Given her pre­viously
voiced views on Alex Goddard, I doubted she would endorse any potions he might
dispense. But plant medicine has a long history. At least she might know if
they presented any real danger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was schmearing cream cheese on the bagels, but she put
down the plastic knife, took the two bottles, and exam­ined them skeptically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;These are not 'herbal extracts,' &quot; she declared
giving her first analysis before even opening them. &quot;They're both
manufactured drugs. The gel-caps have names on them. It's a Latin American pharmaceutical
company.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she opened the first bottle, took out one of the caps,
crushed it between her fingers, and sniffed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Uh-huh, just what I thought.&quot; Then she touched a
pinch of the white powder to her tongue. &quot;Right.&quot; She made a face and
wiped her tongue with a tissue. &quot;Except it's much stronger than the usual
version. I can tell you right now that this drug, in this potency, is illegal
in the U.S.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What was it? I wondered. Cocaine? And how could she tell its
potency with just a taste? Then I reminded myself why I'd come to her in the
first place: She'd been around the track many, many times.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's gonadotropin,&quot; she said glaring at me. Like,
you damned fool. &quot;I'm virtually certain. The trade name here in the U.S.
is Pergonal, though that's not what this is. This is a much stronger
concoction, and I can see some impurities.&quot; She settled the bottle onto
her desk with what seemed almost a shudder. &quot;This is the pharmaceutical
equivalent of hundred-and-ninety-proof moonshine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What is it? What's it supposed it do?&quot; Jesus, I
thought, what's he giving me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's a hormone extracted from the urine of menopausal
women. It triggers a greater than normal egg production and release. It's
sometimes prescribed together with Lupron, which causes your body to release a
similar hormone. Look, if you want to try Pergonal, the real version, I'll
write you a prescription, though I honestly don't think it's going to do you
the slightest bit of good.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I'd almost been
considering giving Alex Goddard the benefit of the doubt, at least till I found
out more about him, and now he hands me this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now we both were looking at the other bottle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you think that is?&quot; I asked, pointing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She broke the plastic seal, opened it, and looked in. It too
was a white powder sealed in gel-caps, and she gave one a sniff, then the taste
test.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have no idea.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She set the bottle back on her desk, and I stared at it,
terrified of what it might be. Finally I got up my courage and reached for it.
A white sticker had been wrapped around it, with directions for taking . . .
whatever it was . . . written on it. Then I happened to notice that one corner
showed the edge of another label, one beneath the hand-applied first one. I
lifted a letter opener off her desk and managed to get it under the outer
label. With a little scraping and tugging, I got it off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Does this mean anything to you?&quot; I asked her,
handing it back. &quot;It's in Spanish, but the contents seem to be HMG
Massone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't believe it,&quot; she said, taking the bottle
as though lifting a cobra. I even got the distinct feeling she didn't want to
leave any fingerprints on it. &quot;That's an even more powerful drug to
stimulate ovarian follicles and induce superovulation. It's highly illegal in
this country. Anybody who gives these drugs in combination to a patient is
flirting with an ethics charge, or worse.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I think I gasped. What was he trying to put into my body?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She settled the bottle back on the desk, her eyes growing
narrow. &quot;Since you say his 'nurse' or assistant or whatever she was gave
you this, I suppose there's always the chance she made an innocent mistake. But
still, what's he doing with this stuff at all? They manufacture it down in
Mexico, and also, I've heard, somewhere in Central America, but it's not
approved in the U.S. Anybody who dispenses this to a patient is putting their
license at risk.&quot; She paused to give me one of those looks. &quot;Assuming
Alex Goddard even has a medical license. These 'alternative medicine' types
sometimes claim they answer to a higher power, they're board-certified by
God.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't for a minute think it was an 'innocent
mistake.' &quot; I was beginning to feel terribly betrayed and violated. I also
was getting mad as hell, my fingertips tingling. &quot;But why would he give me
these drugs at all? Did he somehow—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think you'd better ask him,&quot; she said passing me
a bagel piled high with cream cheese and sturgeon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She bit into her own bagel and for a while we both just
chewed in silence. I, however, had just lost all my appetite. Alex Goddard who
might well be my last chance for a baby, had just dispensed massive doses of
illegal drugs to me. Which, my longtime ob/gyn was warning me, were both un­necessary
and unethical.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you think I should do?&quot; I asked finally,
breaking the silence but barely able to get my voice out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She didn't say anything. She'd finished her bagel, and now
she'd begun wrapping up the container of cream cheese, fold­ing the wax paper
back over the remaining sturgeon. I thought her silent treatment was her way of
telling me my brunch consultation was over. She clearly was exasperated with
me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me tell you a story,&quot; she said finally, as she
carefully began putting the leftover sturgeon back into the Zabar's bag.
&quot;When I was eight years old all the Jews in our Polish ghetto were
starving because the Nazis refused to give us food stamps. So my father bribed
a Nazi officer to let him go out into the countryside to try to buy some eggs
and flour, any­thing, just so we could eat. The farmer came that Saturday
morning in a horse-drawn wagon to pick up my father. At the last minute, I
asked to go with him and he let me. That night the Nazis liquidated our entire
ghetto, almost five thou­sand people. No one else in my family survived. Not my
mother, not my two sisters, not anyone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her voice had become totally dispassionate, matter-of- fact,
as though repression of the horror was the only way a sane person could deal
with it. She could just as easily have been describing a country outing as she
continued. I did no­tice, however, that her East European accent had suddenly
become very prominent, as though she was returning there in her thoughts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When we learned what had happened, my father asked the
farmer we were visiting to go to a certain rural doctor we knew and beg him to
give us some poison, so we could commit suicide before the Nazis got us too.
The doctor, how­ever, told him he had only enough poison for his own family. He
did, however, give him a prescription for us. But when my father begged that
farmer to go to a pharmacy and get the poison, he and his entire family
refused. Instead, they hid us in their barn for over a year, even though they
knew it meant a firing squad if the Nazis found us.&quot; She glared at me.
&quot;Do you understand what I'm saying? They told us that if we wanted to do
something foolish because we were des­perate, we would have to do it without
their help.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was the first time I ever knew her real story. I was
stunned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What, exactly, are you driving at?&quot; I think I
already knew. The long, trusting relationship we'd shared was now teetering on
the brink. By going to see Alex Goddard—even if it was partly a research trip
to check him out—I had disappointed her terribly. She'd lost respect for me.
She thought I was desperate and about to embark on something foolish.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm saying do whatever you want.&quot; She got up and
lifted her coat off the corner rack. &quot;But get those drugs out of here. I
don't want them anywhere near this office. I tried everything legal there was
to get you pregnant. If that wasn't good enough for you and now you want to go
to some quack, that's your affair. Let me just warn you that combining go­nadotropin
and HMG Massone at these dosages is like put­ting your ovaries on steroids; you
get massive egg production for a couple of cycles, but the long-term damage
could be severe. I strongly advise you against it, but if you insist and then
start having complications, I would appreciate not being involved.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Translation: If you start fooling around with Alex God­dard,
don't ever come back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It felt like a dagger in my chest. What was I going to do?
One thought: Okay, so these drugs aren't the way, but you couldn't help me get
pregnant. All I did was spend twenty thousand dollars on futile procedures. Not
to mention the heartbreak.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know,&quot; I said finally, maybe a little sharply,
&quot;I think we ought to be working together, not at cross-purposes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're welcome to think what you like,&quot; she
bristled. &quot;But I have to tell you I don't appreciate your tone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I guess I'd really ticked her off, and it hurt to do it.
Then, finally, her own rejection of me was sinking in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So that's it? You're telling me if I try anything
except exactly what you want me to, then just don't ever come back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've said all I intend to.&quot; She was resolutely
ushering me toward the door, her eyes abruptly blank.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, I told myself, going from anger to despair, then back
to anger, whatever else I might think about Alex Goddard, at least he doesn't
kick people out because of their problems, even a sad soul like Tara.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Still, what about these illegal drugs? There I was, caught in
the middle—between an honorable woman who had failed, and Alex Goddard, who'd
just lived up to my worst suspi­cions. Heading down in the elevator, alone, I
could still hear Hannah Klein's rejection, and warning, ringing in my ears.
Maybe she had just confirmed that still, small voice of ra­tionality lecturing
me from the back of my mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I marched out onto the empty Sunday streets of upper
Broadway, and when I got to the corner, I stood for a long moment looking up at
the pitiless blue of the sky. The sun was there, but in my soul I felt all the
light was gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally I opened the first bottle and then, one by one, I
began taking out the gel-caps and dropping them into the rainwater grate there
at my feet, watching them bounce like the metal sphere in an old pinball
machine before disappear­ing into the darkness below. When both bottles were
empty, I tossed them into the wire trash basket I'd been standing next to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The next time I saw Alex Goddard, he was going to have a hell
of a lot of explaining to do. Beginning with why he'd given me a glimmer of
hope, only to then cruelly snatch it back. I found myself hating him with all
my being.</span></p>

<h2><a name=bookmark12>Chapter Ten</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='color:windowtext'>I</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> headed on back downtown, planning to
take a bath, change clothes, and then recalibrate my game plan. Maybe, I
thought, I ought to just go up to the editing room at Applecore, try some rote
work to help tranquilize my thoughts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But first things first. About halfway there, at Thirty-eighth
Street, I pulled over and double-parked by a Korean deli, and surveyed the
flowers they had out front, an array of mul­ticolored blooms that virtually
blocked entry to the doorway of the tiny grocery. Azaleas, chrysanthemums,
birds-of-paradise, but I wanted the pink roses. At ten dollars a bunch, they
seemed the right touch. I dug out a twenty and picked two.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Still standing on the street, I pulled them to me and inhaled
deeply. As far back as I could remember, I'd always loved the scent of roses.
I'd never really thought myself pretty, the natural-blond often-dyed-brown hair
notwithstanding, but just having roses around somehow made me feel that way. I
wanted to be engulfed in them, especially any time confusion threatened to get
the upper hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Five minutes later and I was at Twenty-first Street. I'd
arrived. My refuge, my one-bedroom cocoon. Time to col­lapse into a hot bath,
wonder why Alex Goddard had given me illegal drugs, and contemplate roses.  I
was looking for a parking space when my cell phone rang. No, don't bother, I
told myself. Enough intrusion for one day. Then I remembered I'd sprung for the
caller-ID feature, and I glanced down at the little liquid crystal slot. It was
a number I happened to know, Lou's place downtown. One eye still on the street,
I reached over and picked it up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Finally got you,&quot; he boomed. &quot;Where the heck
are you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I just got home from—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah, I know where you been. Dave told me.&quot; He
paused, as though he was holding off on some important announce­ment.
&quot;Hang on a sec. There's somebody here might like to speak to you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I thought about Lou's makeshift digs, lots of &quot;heir­loom&quot;—worn-out—family
furniture he'd lugged along with him. Sarah and I used to play on the couch,
and it still had a dim mauve stain where I'd once dumped a glass of
&quot;grape&quot; Kool-Aid on her head when she was six. Whatever else, defi­nitely
not a Soho look.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I heard a whispery voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi, Morgy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was a tentative utterance I'd heard only once before, when
she was waking up after falling off a playground swing. She'd been knocked out
cold for a moment and I'd been frantic, wetting a handkerchief in the nearby
fountain and desperately rubbing it over her face. When she came to, she'd
gazed up into my eyes and greeted me as though we'd just met.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before I could recover and say anything, Lou came back on.
&quot;We're practicing eating chicken-noodle soup. And we're trying to do a
little talking. Why don't you come on down? She asked about you earlier this
morning, said, 'Where's Morgy?' &quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Lou! This is incredible!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You gotta believe in miracles, right? Just come on
down.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is she . . . God, you've got it.&quot; My hopes went
into orbit as I clicked off the phone and revved my engine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I could have swamped him with a lot of questions then and
there, but I immediately decided I wanted to see her first, with my own eyes. I
still couldn't quite believe it was true. On the other hand, a weekend partial
recovery was not totally beyond the realm of medical possibility. With a coma,
so little is understood that anything's possible. Lou was right. This was
definitely a weekend of the unexpected.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'd been close to the deaths of people near to me, both my
parents for starters, but I'd never been close to the restoration of life. It's
hard to explain the rush of joy when you think somebody is gone for good and
then they pop up again, like they'd never been lost. And with Sarah that
feeling was es­pecially jarring. It was almost as though some part of me had
come back alive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The fact is, since Sarah and I were both only children, we'd
identified a lot with each other. True, we'd traveled our separate paths, each
looking, perhaps, for something to fill the lonely void in our lives that a
sibling might have taken. As a child of the dusty, empty plains of West Texas,
I didn't see other kids very much during the summer, and I made up reasons why
she and I should visit each other as often as possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Once, when I was plowing, turning over oat stubble—yes, my
dad warily let me do that if I asked—I unearthed a rabbit nest full of little
baby cottontails. Sarah was coming to visit the next day, and I rescued the
infants so we could play nurs­ery. We fed them milk with little eyedroppers,
and before long Sarah decided she was actually a reincarnated mother rabbit.
That was when she became a vegetarian, and she re­mained so—by her account—till
she finished college. It was just another of those magic moments of childhood I
ended up sharing with her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I also sometimes wondered, as you might have guessed, what it
would've been like to be born a boy. I was definitely a tomboy, had a real
collie (my own version of Lassie), liked to climb trees and dig holes in the
hardscrabble West Texas earth. Maybe that was why I felt so at home—free
associat­ing now—when I filmed my documentary of the Maya vil­lage in Mexico's
Yucatan. It was hot and dry and lay under a pitiless sun, a blazing white bone
in the sky that seared the spare landscape. None of my crew could understand
how anybody could bear to live in such a place, but to me it seemed perfectly
natural, almost like home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thoughts of which now made me sad. I only wish my parents had
lived long enough to see that documentary. Maybe then they'd have understood
how terribly lonely I'd been as a child, a loneliness I shared so deeply with
Sarah. Would we ever be together again?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On my hurried trip downtown, I kept wondering what I was
about to encounter. Was it going to be the fantasy-bound Sarah of her girlhood,
perhaps the same Sarah who'd spun out some stuttering vision of a jade mask? Or
would all that be past and would she again be the ambitious, sparkling pre- med
student she'd become when she was in college?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Getting to Soho took only about ten minutes, scant time to
think. Lou's place was in what had once been a garment factory sweatshop. He'd
rented it from another agent at the bureau, who had inherited it from a cousin,
a well-known downtown artist, lately dead of AIDS. Lou paid virtually no rent,
was there mainly to keep out squatters, and couldn't care less that he was
living in one of New York's trendier sections. All he knew was that there was
plenty of room, and free parking on the street for his old Buick.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'd been down many times before. Inside, the space was still
inhabited spiritually by the dead artist, with acrylic paint spattered on walls
and graffiti I didn't fully understand in the bathroom. The place seemed to be
a broom-free area, with layers of the past littered on the floor like an archae­ological
excavation. And the old Kool-Aid-stained furniture, fitting right in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What always struck me, though, was the number of photos of
Sarah. They were everywhere in the open space, on tables, the desk, several on
the walls. Mostly they were old, several blown up and cropped from snapshots,
grainy. The space felt like a shrine to her memory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When Lou let me in, I was greeted by a spectral face, a
wheelchair, and a valiant attempt at smiling normalcy. Maybe Lou thought it was
real, was progress, but I was immediately on guard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was Sarah's eyes that caught me. They pierced into my soul
and we seemed to click, just like always, only this time it was as though all
our life together passed between us. I had the sense she was trying to tell me
something with her eyes that went beyond words, that she was trying to reach
out to me, perhaps to recapture that shared understanding we'd had years ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Lou introduced me to a Mrs. Reilly, a kindly, Irish-looking
practical nurse who was part of the outpatient package the hospital provided.
She wore a white uniform and was around sixty, with short-bobbed gray hair and
an air of total author­ity. She'd just finished feeding Sarah a bowl of soup,
and was brushing out her cropped blond hair, what there was of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mrs. Reilly glanced at me, but never broke the rhythm of her
strokes. &quot;She's tired now, but she's already stronger than she was.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Lou spoke up. &quot;They called me early yesterday
morning. But by the time I got around to trying to reach you, you'd vanished.
So I rang Dave and he told me where you were, up there with that
crackpot.&quot; He was grinning. No, make that beaming like the famous cat.
&quot;By last night, she was walking with some help, so they said she might as
well be here. Like I said, it's a miracle.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You brought her home just this morning?&quot; I
couldn't believe the hospital would discharge her so soon, but this was the HMO
Age of medical cost-cutting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Only been here a couple of hours.&quot; He pointed to a
shiny set of parallel steel railings in the corner. &quot;That's for physical
therapy. Right now she can only walk with somebody on either side holding her,
but in a few days, I figure . . .&quot; His voice trailed off, as though he
didn't want to tempt fortune. Then he turned toward Sarah. &quot;In a few days,
right, honey?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She nodded, then finally spoke directly to me. &quot;Morgy, I
want some clothes. Please. I hate these horrible hospital things. I never want
to see them again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I noticed that she'd started crying, a line of tears down
each emaciated cheek. Was it something to do with seeing me? I wondered. Then
she began trying to struggle out of the blue bed shift she was wearing, though
she didn't have the strength.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll get you something great, Sar, don't worry.&quot; I
reached to stay her hand. It was, I thought, extraordinarily cold, even though
the loft itself was warm as toast. What kind of clothes should I buy for her? I
found myself wondering. Blouses with buttons? Pullovers? What could she manage?
Maybe I'd bring some items from home first and let her try them out. We used to
be about the same size, though now she was all skin and bones.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I moved a chair next to her, took her other hand, and leaned
as close as I dared. I desperately wanted to put my arms around her, but I
wasn't sure how she would respond to my touch. Her eyes, however, were clear
and had never looked a deeper blue. &quot;Sar, what's the matter? Why're you
crying? You should be happy. Your dad's right here and he loves you and we're
going to take wonderful care of you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who? Him?&quot; she asked, looking straight at Lou, her
blue eyes like an unblinking camera's lens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The plaintive question took my breath away. Hadn't they been
talking for two days?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't pay any attention when she says things like
that,&quot; Mrs. Reilly declared, her voice just above a whisper. &quot;She's
still not quite herself. She drifts in and out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She seemed to be drifting in and out at the moment, though it
was mostly out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she looked directly at me, only now her eyes were losing
their laser-like focus, were starting to seem glazed. &quot;Who're you?&quot;
She reached out and touched my unwashed hair, running her hands through the
tangled strands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next she stared off, terrified, her eyes full of fear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The smoke,&quot; she whispered. &quot;The knife. I'm
next.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Abruptly she was off again in the reverie that had enfolded
her that first time in the hospital. Or at least that was what I guessed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; I felt like shaking
her, except I was too shook-up myself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She turned back, and for a moment she just stared glassy-
eyed, first at me, next at Lou, and finally at Mrs. Reilly. Then she reached
for a glass of orange juice on the table beside her. She looked at it as though
it were some potion, then slowly drank it off, not pausing once. Outside, a
faint police siren could be heard, and I was afraid it was distracting her.
Anyway, something told me her momentary séance was played out. Her face had
grown calm and rested, though I could barely repress a tremble.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Whatever you think,&quot; I said finally, slipping an
arm around her shoulder, &quot;we're both right here. And we love you and we
want to help you get better.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She didn't say anything more, just closed her eyes and
drifted away. But it wasn't back into a coma, since her breath­ing was growing
heavier. I wanted to grab her and yell at her and demand that she come back to
us, but I was fearful of what effect it might have.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What the hell was she talking about?&quot; Lou asked
finally, his voice quavering.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know,&quot; I said, as puzzled as he was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when Mrs. Reilly spoke up. She was the only one not
upset.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When they come out of a coma, sometimes they're not
right for a while.&quot; She patted Sarah's hand then gave it a solicitous
squeeze. &quot;I once had a man wake up and start talking about magic trips
through the air, about how he was a dual citizen of the earth and the sea. He
was talking like a lunatic. One day he would know his family, and the next he
would look at them and start screaming they'd come to kill him. You just never
know how these things will go at first. But she'll be herself before
long.&quot; She lifted Sarah's limp hand up to her cheek, then kissed it.
&quot;You're going to be all right, dear. I've seen enough like you to
know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then what do you make of what she just said?&quot; Lou
asked her, having given up on me. &quot;Earlier this morning she was fine. Knew
who I was, everything. Then the minute Mor­gan comes in, she starts making up
that loony jabber.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The sanguine Mrs. Reilly just shrugged as if it didn't re­ally
matter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For my own part, I didn't necessarily like him implying my
arrival had caused her to relapse into her dream world of terror. It seemed to
me that whenever I showed up, she started trying to tell me what was really
eating away at her soul.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, I told myself finally, maybe she's regressed back to
when we were kids, when we only had each other to share our secrets with. What
if we've rebonded in some new, spe­</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>cial way? It
would be natural, actually. She's trying to reach out to me, like long ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now she appeared to be dozing off, exhausted, her head
tipping downward toward her blue hospital shift. Mrs. Reilly took that as a
hint, and slowly began wheeling her toward the bedroom, leaving me alone with
Lou.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I glanced over at him, thinking more and more that I had to
do something, track down what had happened to her. I wanted to do it for me,
but even more for him. I'd never seen him so despondent. Maybe it was the thing
scholars call the curse of rising expectations. Back when she was hardly more
than a vegetable, he was overjoyed by a flickering eyelid. Now that she was
talking, he wanted all of her back. Instead, though, it seemed as if she had
returned to us for a moment, only to be snatched away again. I could tell it
was killing him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, I'm sorry that when I showed up, she started
going off the deep end.&quot; I wanted desperately to help, but at that moment
I felt powerless. &quot;Maybe I should just stay away for a while.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nah, she loves having you here. Don't worry. But any­way,
Dave said something about you taking a couple of days off. Maybe I can use that
time to be here with her and settle her down.&quot; Then he grimly took out her
locket and rubbed its worn silver in his fingers, his eyes brimming with his
heartache. &quot;This is all just so damned confusing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was he telling me, indirectly, that I should go away and
leave them alone? First Hannah Klein rejects me, and now <i>et tu</i>, Lou?
Maybe, I thought, he's taking out his despair on me, blaming me for her
relapse. Truthfully, I guess I was blaming myself a bit too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Listen, I'm going to go home now and leave you two
alone,&quot; I said. &quot;But why don't you see if you can get her to talk
some more? Without me around, maybe she'll make more sense.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If she wants to say something, I'll listen.&quot; He
gave me a strong, absent embrace, his eyes still despondent. &quot;But no way
am I gonna start pushing her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I edged into the bedroom, unsure if I really should, to say
good-bye to Sarah and to give her one last hug. Her eyes were open again and
she just stared at me for a second, then whispered a word I couldn't quite make
out. It might have sounded like &quot;Babylon,&quot; but that made no sense at
all. Fi­nally she covered her eyes with her hands and turned away, gone from
me, leaving me more alone than I'd ever felt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='color:windowtext'>H</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>eading home, finally, I told myself
to try to calm down. I was determined to help Sarah get over her trauma, though
truthfully I was too tired to really think straight at that mo­ment. So instead
I decided to let everything rest for a few hours and try for some distance. In
fact, I began imagining myself in a hot bath, gazing at my now-wilting roses.
Home Sweet Home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mine was a standard one-bedroom in a building that had been
turned into a co-op five years earlier, the owner offering the individual
apartments to the tenants. I'd stayed a renter, however, passing up the
&quot;low&quot; insider price, $138,000, be­cause I didn't really have the
money, and when I did have it someday I would want something bigger. I wished I
had more space—a real dining room and a bigger bathroom would do for starters,
along with some place for more bookcases. And if a baby should someday
miraculously come along . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'd often thought you could tell a lot about somebody from
where and how they lived; it's revealing as a Rorschach test. What, I often
wondered, did my apartment say about me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A decorator might conclude I'd done up the place with love,
then lazily let it go. They'd decide I cared about nice things, but once those
nice things were there, I neglected them. It would be true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'd covered the walls of the living room with pale blue
cloth, then hung a lot of framed pictures and old movie post­ers. Okay, I like
movies. For me even the posters are art. My couch was an off-white, more like
dirt-colored actually, and covered with pillows for the &quot;feminine&quot;
touch. I'd hoped you'd have to look twice to realize it was actually a storage
cabinet in disguise, with drawers along the bottom of the front. The floor was
polished hardwood, rugs from India here and there, in sore need of a vacuuming,
and even a couple of deceased insects that'd been there for over a week. That
sort of said it, I thought glumly. I'm a workaholic slob.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The bedroom revealed even more about me. The bed was a brass
four-poster, queen-size, partly covered by an heirloom quilt. It hadn't been
made in a week. (Who has the time?) The room itself was long and divided into
areas for work and sleep. Opposite the bed itself was an antique English desk,
on which sat my old Macintosh, and next to that was my file cabinet, the
indispensable part of the &quot;home office&quot; the IRS loves to hate. On top
of it was a stack of marked-up scripts, notes scribbled all over them in six
different colors. You never re­alize movies are so complicated till you see a
breakdown sheet. Camera angles and voice-overs and . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next to the bed was a violin case and three books about
Indian ragas. What was that about? somebody might wonder. Some kind of Indian
music nut? I was, albeit a very mini­mally talented nut.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The kitchen was the New York efficiency kind painted a glossy
tan, the color of aerosol olive oil. The cabinets con­tained mostly packages of
pasta, instant soup, and coffee filters. Not even any real food. I live on deli
takeout these days. An inventory of my fridge at this moment would clock two
cartons of &quot;fresh squeezed&quot; orange juice, a half quart of spoiling
milk, a bag of coffee beans, plastic containers of wilting veggies from the
corner salad bar, and three bottles of New York seltzer. That was it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>God help me, I thought, my mind-state turning even more</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>morose. This
is my life. I had become that retrograde Woman of the Nineties: works ninety
hours a week, makes ninety thou a year, weighs ninety pounds, and thinks
(pardon my French) Cooking and Fucking are provinces in northern China. Well,
the ninety-pounds part of that obscene quip didn't fit—and it wasn't the
nineties anymore, anyway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In any case, was my apartment a place to raise a child? No
earthly way. Like Carly, I'd have to spring for some decent space, preferably
with a washing machine. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A parking slot was open right in front of my building, a
minor miracle on this day of uncertain events. As I was pull­ing in, I glanced
over to see a man walking past, not catching the face but sensing something
familiar in the walk. He was in the process of unbuttoning a Federal Express
uniform, peeling away the top to reveal a dark suit. He certainly seemed to be
in a big hurry, carrying an unmarked shopping bag. Maybe, I thought, his shift
was over and he was meeting his wife, or a friend.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I wondered if he'd left a package for me, and told myself to
check with the super. Not the usual delivery guy—did they come on Sunday
now?—and also . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Where was the truck? They always parked right here by the
building.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was still so upset over Sarah, I couldn't immediately
process those illogical observations, so I just grabbed my pink roses, dripping
from the bottom of their paper wrapping, and opened the car door. It was
definitely good to be home. I loved my Chelsea neighborhood, where you got to
know the locals, running into them in the delis, the little restau­rants, the
dry cleaners. Just like a small town. If you worked at home, the way I
sometimes did, you even got to know the mailman and the delivery guys for UPS
and FedEx. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hey! That guy. I finally placed the walk, a kind of a strut.
He was the slimeball who'd been outside Paula Marks' building last week,
carrying a gun and threatening me. What's he doing here?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My pulse went off the charts. Was he one of Nicky Russo's
wiseguy crew after all? Had he come back, with his pistol, to pay me a return
engagement?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Chill out, I told myself, take a deep breath. He's leaving.
Just try and find out who he is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Roses in one hand held up awkwardly around my face, I slowly
ambled down the street after him. I didn't have to go far. Within about a
hundred feet, he unlocked a long black Lincoln Towncar, stepped out of the
FedEx camouflage, tossed it onto the seat along with the bag he was carrying,
pulled the cap off his bald head got in, and sped away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The license plate looked different from the usual, but I got
what I needed: DL and a string of numbers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Uh-oh, I thought. Was he leaving a package bomb for me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I turned back and let myself into the outer lobby, glancing
around as I did. There were no parcels anywhere, just blank, brown tile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My apartment was 3A. The name on the bell was M. James. As I
stepped through the inner lobby—still no pack­age—a rumpled face appeared in
the doorway just to my left. The sign on it, flaking, said SUPER.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, hi.&quot; The voice was Patrick Mooney, our
superinten­dent, who did not normally emerge to greet those arriving. But there
had been complaints from the building's managing agent that he could never be
found for emergencies, so he probably wanted to appear available, even on
Sundays. His voice was slurred from some midday medicinal Irish whisky.
&quot;Thought you were home. FedEx guy was here earlier look­ing for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Oh, boy. &quot;Did he leave a package?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He had something with him, if that's what you mean.
Like a bag of some kind.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And you let him go up?&quot; I couldn't believe what I
was hearing. I felt a rush of dismay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Said he had to. Needed a signature.&quot; Patrick
Mooney then shrugged and reached for the dooijamb to steady himself, his whisky
breath wafting across the hall. Great security.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I stepped into the elevator as the door was clanking shut,
and watched as he rubbed his eyes and eased his own door closed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now I was really puzzled. If the FedEx guy came
&quot;earlier,&quot; why was he just now leaving? A lot of scary theories went
through my mind as I pushed the button for the third floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I took a deep breath as the elevator opened, but again I saw
no packages. So far so good. Getting off, I set down my roses on the hall
carpet and fumbled for my key. When I inserted it, the lock felt a little
rough, causing me to think for an instant I'd used the wrong key, but then it
responded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What had caused that? I wondered. Had the guy been fid­dling
with my door, wiring a bomb? Using one hand I pushed it open, again holding my
breath and standing aside, but it opened okay. I exhaled, then reached back to
drag in the flow­ers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But if he didn't leave a package, what was he doing here?
Casing out where I lived? Planting a bug in the elevator? And why was he here
so long?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The place was dark when I stepped in, the drapes drawn. I
relocked the door, then surveyed the gloom. No explosions, so I guessed he
didn't plan to kill me. Yet. Here I was, home, safe and sound. I just stood a
minute, still uneasy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I remembered the flowers, my dripping bouquet, and
headed for the kitchen. Deal with them, and then maybe get a bottle of white
wine out of the fridge and sip some in the bath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>After my
unnerving sequence with Sarah, thoughts of going to the office had zero appeal.
Time to lighten up, way up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Preoccupied, not looking around, I stuffed the roses into a
vase by the sink, and then I thought again about the white wine and opened the
refrigerator. I'd still not bothered to turn on any lights, but the kitchen and
its ancient fridge were dimly illuminated by the tiny window just across. I
wasn't sure where I'd put the bottle, since I'd had to rearrange things to make
room for the dup of Carly's interview. (I was also planning to take home a
safety dup of Paula's interview sometime later in the week.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why was I doing that? Taking home copies? It was a sign of
deep compulsion. You couldn't really make a professional- quality second
negative from a first positive—by that time it would be third-generation—but
I'd brought it anyway. Now and then I just have a raw instinct that keeping a
safety backup around is a good idea. But the canister had ended up devouring
the entire lower shelf of the fridge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I opened the white door and peered in. The light was out, and
for a moment I stared numbly at the dark, half-filled shelves. The only thing
that struck me as odd was that I could see the pure white of the empty bottom
shelf.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For a second I could only stand and stare, but then I backed
away, trying to figure out what was wrong, and stumbled over something. I
regained my balance and flipped on the overhead light.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The floor around me was littered with bottles, my old
toaster, my tiny microwave. It was a total shambles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I recoiled stumbling again, this time over cans strewn across
the linoleum. My kitchen, it was slowly sinking in, had been completely
trashed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I felt a visceral wave of nausea. It's the scariest thing in
the world having your space invaded like a form of psychic rape. I sagged
against the refrigerator as I gazed around. The cabinets had been emptied out,
a hasty and haphazard search. Quick and extremely dirty, as glass containers of
condiments, including an old bottle of dill pickles, were shattered and their
contents smeared into the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't believe this.&quot; I marched back into the
living room and reached for the lights. This room too had been turned upside
down. The TV, stereo, VCR, all had been swept onto the rug. But they were still
there. That guy, that animal, who did this wasn't a thief. He'd been looking
for something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My breath now coming in pulses, I edged into the bedroom and
switched on the light. The bed was the way I'd left it, the covers thrown back
and the pillows in a pile. The clock radio was there, and so was the old Mac,
still on the table in the far corner, my &quot;workstation.&quot; Again nothing
seemed to be missing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I headed back to the kitchen, where the refrigerator door was
still open. I gazed at the interior a moment, still puzzled, trying to figure out
what wasn't right. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shit! Shit! Shit! That's what was wrong. The field of white
bottom shelf was empty. Totally empty. The film canister of Paula's interview
was gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For a moment I just leaned against the kitchen counter,
barely pushing aside an impulse to throw up in the sink. Think, I told myself,
get a grip and think. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was the film he'd wanted. And he'd wanted it badly enough
to pick the lock, then rip my home apart looking for it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I pulled at a tangle of hair, feeling my mind in chaos, and
tried to reason out the situation. Why? Why would he steal a positive that
couldn't be used for anything?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally the real truth of what had happened hit me like a
fist in the chest. My Home Sweet Home had been violated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Seething, I went into the living room and reached for the
phone, the only thing not on the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My first instinct was to call David, but then I decided he'd
just go into a tizzy of hysteria and be no support at all. So instead I called
Lou, praying I wouldn't wake Sarah. In an unsteady voice, I tried to tell him
what had happened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He seemed puzzled to hear from me again so soon, but then he
quickly turned FBI, concerned for my safety.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Guy sounds like a professional,&quot; he declared.
&quot;Probably got in with an electric picker, like the Edge. Any asshole can
buy one for a hundred and thirty bucks. It'll rake cylinders at a hundred times
a second. Pro like that, you can be sure there'll be no prints.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why would . . . ?&quot; My voice was still a croak.
&quot;I mean, my God, all for a lousy reel of film?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Fucker wants you to know he's in town. So how he did
it's as important as what he did. It's a time-proven scare tac­tic.&quot; He
paused. &quot;Morgan, I don't like this one bit. There could be more before
this is over.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Think I should call the cops?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Damned right you should,&quot; he said, slowly and
sadly, &quot;but to tell you the truth, they ain't gonna do all that much.
Somebody messed up your apartment and lifted a third-hand copy of a woman
talking. They'll say it sounds more like malicious mischief than a crime. Then
they'll write it up and that'll be the last you'll hear from them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well,&quot; I said, my anger welling up, &quot;maybe I
don't feel quite so laissez-faire. Tell me, you know anybody who can run a
plate for you on a Sunday?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You got the prick's license number?&quot; he exclaimed.
&quot;Why the hell didn't you say so?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Honestly, it sort of slipped my mind. I'm having a
little trouble thinking straight right now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Fortunately my short-term memory is pretty good, even when
I'm stressed, so I spewed it out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't go anywhere,&quot; he declared. &quot;I'll get
back to you in five minutes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I hung up the phone and lay down, flat out on the carpet,
trying a breathing exercise to calm down. The problem was, it wasn't working.
Having had some experience with being robbed—I once got completely cleaned out
when I had a ground-floor apartment down in the Village—I know you go through
certain Kubler-Ross-like stages of anger, denial, de­pression, acceptance. You
also go through a predictable series of recriminations: I should have had window
bars and gates; I should have had a different lock; I should have had two
different locks. In the instance just recalled, I'm virtually certain an
apartment painter duplicated a set of my keys on his lunch break and then
passed them on to a second-story artist. No way to prove that, mind you, but it
had to be what happened. I also suspect he checked my appointments cal­endar to
see when I was going to be out of town.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But in this case the lock was definitely picked. Nobody had a
set of my keys except the super, and Steve. So the guy with the Spanish accent
knew how to slip through doors and he had no financial interest in my old VCR.
He only had an interest in my film. What had he said there on the sidewalk
outside Paula Marks's apartment? Something about how making this picture was a
big mistake?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I jumped as the phone erupted by my ear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The name Colonel Jose Alvino Ramos Grijalva mean
anything to you?&quot; Lou asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How could it? I'm not sure I can even pronounce
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, Colonel Ramos declares himself to be a military
attaché at the Guatemalan Consulate here. You've got a big shot in the
Guatemalan Army rummaging through your apartment. This is even worse than I
thought. Those guys are killers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jesus.&quot; I was still coming to grips with the
horrifying fact he'd been in my apartment, in my only refuge. &quot;Think I
could bring charges against him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, let's consider this a minute. Probably no prints,
no credible witness. You'd have a damned hard time proving anything.&quot; He
sighed. &quot;Truth is, I doubt you could even get a restraining order, given
what little you've got to work with.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The bastard.&quot; I sat a moment, feeling the logical,
left side of my brain just shut down. My mind went back to its most primitive
level, running on adrenaline. &quot;Look, I need to check out something. I'll
call you in the morning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, be careful,&quot; he said warily. &quot;And for
God's sake don't go running off anyplace alone. I'm telling you you're not
safe. Always be around people.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll keep it in mind.&quot; With that I gently hung up the
phone and exhaled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Think. Some colonel from Guatemala just broke into my
apartment looking for what I might know about Children of Light, where I've
been going to see about having a baby. So why is he so interested in what I'm
doing?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I remembered Alex Goddard wanted me to go to a
&quot;clinic&quot; he had somewhere in Central America. Ten to one that clinic
was in Guatemala. That was what this whole thing was about. And now he'd just
gone back there; at least that was what he'd said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Guatemala was a long way off, but his other operation was
right up the river. I hadn't seen all of it this morning, but that was about to
change. A lot of things were about to change. It was time to start getting the
playing field level again.</span></p>

<h2><a name=bookmark14>Chapter Twelve</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='color:windowtext'>I</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> arranged with Patrick Mooney to have
his sister in Queens, a full-figured woman named Rosalyn, come in and finish
the job of reconstructing my wrecked home. She ar­rived an hour and a half
later, and was hard at work when I left. I also agonized over the police-report
issue, but finally decided to forgo the bother. Lou was right: It would be a
two-hour ordeal of futility. Besides, I had better things to do with my time. I
was going to return the favor of an infor­mation-gathering expedition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alex Goddard had said he'd be absent from Quetzal Manor—who
knows for how long—and this time around I was going to do the place right, the
next step in my under­cover research. The first, and main, thing I wanted to do
was explore the new high-tech clinic that sat nestled in the woods across from
the old building. Everything about it was the exact opposite of a
&quot;Manor.&quot; Not a shred of New Age &quot;spiri­tuality,&quot; just a lot
of digital equipment and ultrasound and . . . what else? Chief among my
questions: What was behind that big, white door?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe I was being impulsive, but I was completely wired and
the truth was, I wasn't going to sleep till I knew a lot more than I did. And
if I went late tonight, Sunday, I probably wouldn't have to deal with Ramala.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I called Roger Drexel, my unshaven cameraman, and asked him
to come up and meet me at Applecore. It was Sunday and he was watching the
third quarter of a Knicks game and into his second six-pack, but he agreed.
After all, I was his current boss.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All I really wanted was his Betacam and some metal tape,
which would be broadcast quality. (I'd wanted to do it yes­terday, but now the
time had definitely come.) We met at the office, and he unlocked the room with
the camera gear and loaded in a fresh tape. With any luck, he made it home for
the end of the game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I then had a sinful cheeseburger and fries at a Greek diner
two blocks down the avenue. It was my idea of a courage- bolstering indulgence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My watch read six thirty-five and daylight was waning when I
revved my old Toyota and started my northbound trek back to Quetzal Manor. When
I was passing the George Washington Bridge, the first drifting flakes of a
freak late-season snowstorm began pelting my windshield. Good I thought,
turning on my wipers, the less visibility, the better. At least I believed that
till the road started getting slippery and I had to throttle back. It was only
then I realized I'd been pushing eighty on the speedometer, passing a lot of
cars. Lou's warning not to go anywhere alone was still filed in the back of my
mind but I kept trying not to think about it. Sometimes there are things you've
just got to do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The highway grew more treacherous the farther north I went,
but the traffic was thinning out and by the time I reached the turnoff to
Quetzal Manor, total darkness had set in, in addition to which the paving was
covered with at least an inch of sparkling-new pristine snow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I eased up the roadway, my headlights made the trees
around me glisten with their light dusting of white, like frost­ing on the tips
of a buzz cut. I switched off my lights as I made the last turn in the road but
not before catching a glimpse of Quetzal Manor, and I must confess to feeling a
shudder, of both anger and apprehension, run through me as I watched its
magisterial turrets disappear into the snowy dark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I parked my car at the back of the lot and retrieved the
flashlight I'd brought, a yellow plastic two-battery model. I hadn't realized
there'd be snow when I left home, so I was just wearing some old sneakers, but
they'd do. I then sat there in the dark for a long minute, listening to the
silence and thinking. The first thing was to find out if anybody was guarding
the place. The next was to get some video of the new building.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I grabbed the bag carrying the Betacam, tested my flash­light
against the floorboard, and then headed up the snowy driveway. I marched
straight through the open arch that was the front door, and I was again in the
drafty hallway where I'd met Ramala Saturday morning. It was empty and dark
now, no lights anywhere, not even out in the courtyard be­yond. The stony
quiet—no music, no chants—felt unnatural, but it also suggested that Alex
Goddard's adoring acolytes were safely tucked away. Early to bed . . . you know
the rest. So maybe I really had come at the right time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A chilly wind was blowing in from the far end of the hallway,
and I felt like I'd just entered a dank tomb, but I tightened my coat and
pressed on. When I got to the end and looked out, the snowy courtyard was like
a picture postcard. And completely empty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All right, I thought, move on to what you came for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But when I turned and headed back down the hallway, toward
the entry arch, I caught a glimpse of a furtive form, dark and shadowy, lurking
just outside. Shit! I froze in my tracks, but then the figure stepped inside,
wearing something that made me think of Little Red Riding Hood, like a tiny
ghost in a cowl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was Tara, Alex Goddard's spacey waif, who was moving so
oddly, I thought for a moment she might be sleepwalking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She wasn't, of course. She'd just been out strolling around
the driveway in the snow. I soon realized she lived her life in something
resembling a trance, as though she were a per­manent denizen of the spirit
world. For her it was a natural condition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's so beautiful like this,&quot; she mumbled
dreamily, as though we'd been in the middle of a lifelong conversation. &quot;I
just love it.&quot; Her voice was barely above a whisper, but in the silence it
seemed to ricochet off the stone walls. &quot;I want to take them out, show
them God's paintbrush. Will you help me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Take who out?&quot; I asked, immediately deciding to go
with the moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally she looked directly at me and realized whom she'd
been talking to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You were here before. I tried to give you herbs to help
you, but then he came and . . .&quot; Her voice trailed off as she walked back
through the portico and out again into the drift­ing snow. Then she held up her
hands, as though attempting to capture the flakes as keepsakes. &quot;I so want
to show them. They've never seen it before.&quot; She glanced back at me.
&quot;Come on. Let's do it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I followed her out into the drifting white and across the
parking lot, the accumulation of snow was growing denser, enough now to start
covering the cars, but still, some­thing told me the flurry was going to be
short-lived. I took a long, misty breath of the moist air and clicked open the
case holding the Betacam, readying myself to take it out the minute we got
inside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, I thought, maybe I've gotten lucky. She was headed for
the new clinic, which was exactly where I wanted to go. It was nestled in the
trees, up a winding pathway, and as I slogged along I could feel the snow
melting through my sneakers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When we got to the front door, large and made of glass, she
just pushed it open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We never lock anything,&quot; she declared, glancing
back. &quot;It's one of our rules.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The hallway was dark, silent, and empty except for the two of
us. Still, I felt a tinge of caution as we entered. At some level this was
trespassing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come on,&quot; she said, casually flipping a switch on
the right-hand wall and causing the overhead fluorescents to blink on.
&quot;He's away now, and everybody's in bed. But I'll bet they're still awake
in here. It's a perfect time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I didn't feel anything was perfect, but I did know I wanted
to learn what was behind the door I'd seen when I was leav­ing. It was at the
end of the hallway, wide and steel and painted hospital white. And, sure
enough, that was exactly where Tara was heading.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She just kept talking nonstop, in her dreamy, little-girl
voice. &quot;We've got to try and make them understand it's okay. That it'll be
just for a minute.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She shoved open the door without knocking, and my ears were
greeted by the faint strains of Beethoven's &quot;Moonlight Sonata,&quot; one
of my favorites. For an instant I was caught up in the music, a poignant moment
drawing me in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The room itself was spacious, with a row of white bassi­nets
along one side and subdued lighting provided by small fluorescent bulbs along
the walls. It was, I immediately re­alized, a no-frills nursery. Alongside the
bassinets were tables with formula and boxes of Pampers and Handi-Wipes. Two
short women of indefinable nationality—they looked vaguely Asian—were in
attendance, and at the moment one was facing away and bouncing a baby on her
shoulder. Her infant looked like a boy—or was that just my imagination?—and I
felt my heart go out. The light was dim, but I could tell he was a gorgeous
sandy-haired kid plump and peachy, so sublime in his tender vulnerability as he
gazed around with eyes full of trust. He was staring directly back at me and
before I could stop myself, I gave him a little wave and wrinkled my nose. He
stared at me a second then responded with a tiny smile. Hey, I thought, I've
got the touch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come on,&quot; Tara said ignoring the women, &quot;let
me show you. They're all so beautiful.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By then my eyes were adjusting to the subdued light, and as
we walked down the middle of the long room, I confirmed my assumption that the
bassinets next to the tables all con­tained infants. I'm no expert on babies,
but I'd guess they were all around six weeks old maybe a couple of months at
most.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This is the nest, I thought. Ground zero. Kevin and Rachel
were both probably in this room at one time too. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Aren't they wonderful?&quot; Tara was saying, still in
her squeaky, spaced-out voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was opening the Betacam bag when the first woman, the one
holding and lightly bouncing her little boy, absently put her hand under his
quilt, then spoke to the other in deeply accented English.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's wet again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was the first words either of them had uttered. Then she
turned to me in exasperation, assuming, I suppose, that I was one of Alex
Goddard's flock. &quot;And I just changed him.&quot; Again the accent, but I
still couldn't identify it. She made a face, then carried him over to a plywood
changing table in the center of the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I felt a great baby-yearning as I moved over beside her, but
she was behaving like a typical hourly wage-earner, glumly going about her job,
and I just stood there a moment, vainly wanting to hold him, then turned back
to Tara.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where do all these children come from?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ramala says they're orphans or abandoned or something.
From overseas or wherever.&quot; She sighed. &quot;They're so per­fect.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was completely zombied-out. It felt like talking to a
marshmallow on downers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But how, exactly, do—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;People bring them here.&quot; She seemed uninterested
in the question, just plunging on as she wandered on down the line of
bassinets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'd finally come to my senses enough to take out the Betacam,
though the light wasn't actually enough to really work with, certainly not
broadcast quality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stopped and picked up one of the infants out of its
bassinet, then turned back to me, her eyes turning soft as she hugged it the
way she might a small puppy. &quot;Isn't this one cute? I'd so love to have
him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was she on some kind of drug that suppressed curiosity? I
found myself wondering as I panned the camera around the room. There must have
been at least twenty bassinets, all just alike, wicker with a white lace hood.
A couple of the babies were sniffling, and the one Tara had picked up now began
crying outright, much to her annoyance. The room itself smelled like baby
powder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And then what happens?&quot; I asked finally, zooming
in on one of the women.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What happens when?&quot; Now Tara was twirling in a
circle, humming futilely to the shrieking child. &quot;You mean, after they
come here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right.&quot; God, getting answers from her was making
me crazy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The girls here take them to their new mothers.&quot;
Her eyes had turned even more dreamy as she lightly bounced the bawling bundle
she was holding one last time, after which she returned it to its bassinet.
Then she gazed around the room. &quot;It's so sad to see them leave.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Did Paula and Carly get their babies that way? I found myself
wondering. Probably, but it was one more thing I'd neglected to ask.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come on,&quot; Tara continued. &quot;Let's take some of
them out. He makes the nurses try and speak English around the chil­dren, but
they don't really know much. Maybe you could figure out a way to, like,
explain—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tara, I don't think taking any of these babies out into
the snow is a very hot idea. Not tonight. Maybe in the morn­ing.&quot; Stall
her, I thought. She's completely out of it. Then I looked at the woman changing
the baby. Sure enough, I was right. It was a boy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But I want to.&quot; Tara turned crestfallen. &quot;To
show them how beautiful—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I don't speak whatever language they're
speaking,&quot; I said, cutting cut her off. &quot;I'm not even sure I could
make it sound reasonable in English. So you'll have to do it without my
help.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I turned to the woman who'd been changing the baby.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you know where this child came from?&quot; Why not
take a shot?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She just stared at me, alarmed, then turned away. Nothing.
She clearly wasn't going to tell me anything, even if she could. She and the
others were just cheap hired help, prob­ably illegal immigrants without a green
card and scared to death for their jobs. They weren't going to be doing an
in-depth tell-all to anybody.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I thought about the situation for a moment, and decided I'd
seen what I came to see. This was pay dirt. Alex Goddard was running a
full-scale adoption mill, just as Lou had sus­pected. He was collecting
beautiful white babies from &quot;overseas or wherever,&quot; and selling them
here at sixty thousand a pop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which went a long way toward explaining why he didn't want
Children of Light to be featured in my film. And the Guatemalan colonel who'd
just trashed my home was almost certainly in on the operation. Alex Goddard
might be a New Age miracle worker rediscovering ancient Native American herbal
cures, but he also was running a very efficient money machine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Still, the big question kept coming back: Where did he get
all the babies? To extract any more information about that from Quetzal Manor,
I'd have to break into an office somewhere, and I wasn't quite up to that yet.
I didn't have the nerve of Colonel Jose Alvino Ramos.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell you what, Tara, I think I'm out of here.&quot; I
was re­turning the Betacam to its bag. Nothing I'd shot was remotely broadcast
quality, but I did have proof of what was going on. My &quot;undercover&quot;
investigation was making some head­way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay.&quot; She sighed her expression increasingly
glazed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I took one last look around the room, at the row of bas­sinets,
then gave her a parting pat and headed for the exit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look,&quot; I said turning back as I reached the door.
&quot;Don't say anything to anybody about me being here tonight, okay? Can we
just let it be our secret?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sure, whatever.&quot; She shrugged absently. Like, why
not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And Tara, do yourself a favor. Get out of this
place.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But there's nowhere else I can go,&quot; she said
sadness in her eyes. As I slowly closed the door, the last thing I heard was
the sound of the Beethoven sonata dying away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What a day . . . and night. As I walked down the hallway
carrying the camera bag, I tried to process my new informa­tion. I'd just seen
some of the most incredibly lovable babies ever. That part of it was a
beautiful experience, one that pulled at my heartstrings more strongly than I'd
ever imag­ined something like that could. The part that troubled me was, the
babies were so alike, so fair, and . . . they all could have been perfect
siblings for Kevin and Rachel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No, I told myself, surely that was my imagination. Though
they did look amazingly related. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I moved across the parking lot, I thought I saw a movement
in the shadows just inside the entry archway, a quick change in the pattern of
dark. Was it Ramala or one of the girls, I wondered, or was it just my
paranoia?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Keep walking, I told myself. Lose yourself in the snow. The
only way they can stop you from exposing this racket now is to kill you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I got back to my car, I gazed up at the imposing turrets
of Quetzal Manor one last time, wishing there was enough light to film them,
and collected my thoughts. Was the story about the babies being orphans or
abandoned chil­dren or &quot;whatever&quot; really true? I didn't believe it,
not for a minute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But as Carly Grove said, Alex Goddard could &quot;make it
happen.&quot; The problem for me was, he wouldn't tell me where he got the
children, and nobody I'd talked to so far seemed to want to know, not really.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<h2><a name=bookmark15>Chapter Thirteen</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='color:windowtext'>I</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>n moments I was heading down the
snowy drive, south toward my home (which had been hopefully put back to­gether).
I pushed the pace, mesmerized by the snow, and tried to decide what to do next.
The thug Ramos had stolen some second-generation interview footage from me, but
now I had a tape of something a lot more interesting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I pulled into my street, the time was just past eleven
and I was thinking about calling Lou, or Steve, or both. But then I saw
something odd. A woman was walking down the steps from the lobby of my
building, a woman I recognized from somewhere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her hair was tangled and she was wearing black jeans and a
black sweater. It took a second before I finally processed the fact it was
Carly Grove. And she seemed frantic. I as­sumed she’d come in a cab, but she
had my home phone number, so why would she come over if I didn't answer? New
Yorkers don't just drop in. A social no-no.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe the reason had something to do with how she looked. I
felt like I was seeing a specter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thank God you're here,&quot; she blurted out, striding
up. She was actually shaking, and I could tell she'd been crying. Nothing like
the gutsy woman I'd seen a few days earlier. &quot;I kept getting your machine,
but I thought maybe you were hiding.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I looked at her, and forgot all about my own issues. It was
hard to remember ever seeing a human being in such distress, except for Sarah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why would I be hiding?&quot; I was taking out the
Betacam bag and closing my car door, hoping to seem normal and professional.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They called me about six o'clock tonight. Children of
Light.&quot; She could barely get the words out. &quot;They'd seen my interview
with you. How did they get it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I looked down at the snowy—make that slushy—street and felt a
chill go through me, followed immediately by an­ger. Ramos, that bastard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They . . . Somebody took a copy this morning.&quot;
Stated like that, it sounded pretty lame. &quot;I'm so sorry—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He threatened Kevin. He actually said if I signed a re­lease
to let you use the film, my child would 'meet with an accident.' And then he
said something about you, that your own—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who? Who called you? Did he tell you his—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He wouldn't give a name. Just some man. He had a for­eign
accent.&quot; She threw her arms around me, and I hugged her back as best I
could.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where's Kevin now?&quot; I was so concerned about Carly
that I'd repressed the information that he'd also mentioned me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Marcy was there, so I told her to take him with her. To
her mother's place in the Bronx, where she lives.&quot; Carly was still
trembling as she loosened her grip on me. &quot;I called a car service to drive
them up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, come on in. Let's talk.&quot; Truthfully, I
wasn't sure how much I wanted to tell her about what I'd just seen at Quetzal
Manor. It would probably just distress her more. Where had Kevin come from? Did
I really want to de-legitimize him in her eyes?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I led her through the lobby, hoping to appear com­posed,
Patrick Mooney greeted us, announcing that his sister, Rosalyn, had been gone
for an hour and that she appreciated my memorable tip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The place looked like nothing had happened, and Carly
immediately collapsed onto my &quot;earth-tone&quot; couch. I hadn't told her
my apartment had been tossed along with the rob­bery and, thanks to Rosalyn, I
didn't need to. In fact, it ac­tually looked cleaner than it had in months.
Maybe, I thought, I should reprioritize my life and hire her more often.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I got a glass of water for Carly and sat down next to
her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm really sorry,&quot; I began, deeply meaning it.
&quot;If I'd known all this was going to happen, I'd never—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's not your fault.&quot; She took a long drink. I
hadn't both­ered with ice, and I immediately felt I'd been inhospitable. Kind
of a vagrant, minor concern, considering. Then she went on. &quot;I guess I
knew down deep I shouldn't have given you that interview. But I wanted the
world to know about Kevin. Now, though . . . should I call the police or some­thing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The short answer to that was yes, but my mind was already
skipping on to a different topic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Carly, do you know where Kevin came from? Really came
from? Did you ever actually try to find out?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She sighed and took another sip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I told you I don't care. When they brought him, all
pink and helpless, I just—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who brought him?&quot; I interrupted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I'd been up there the day before, signing all the
papers. I was supposed to go up that day, but then somebody called and said one
of the girls who was staying in the clinic or whatever it is was bringing him
to me. So don't come.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're saying one of the girls—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah.&quot; She looked wistful for a moment, as though
re­membering. &quot;Then she just showed up, looked like some blond college
dropout. I guess a little more fanfare would've been nice, but Marcy was there
to help me and that was it. That's the last contact I ever had with Children of
Light.&quot; She shuddered involuntarily. &quot;Till now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, I thought, the last thing I'm going to do is tell her
about what I just saw. She's the ideal customer for Alex God­dard: She truly
doesn't want to know details.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Carly, there's not much I can do about what's already
happened, but I can try to keep you from getting into any more trouble. Why
don't you call them in the morning and tell them you've yelled at me and
rescinded your permission for Applecore to use the film? And say I've promised
I won't. You've threatened to sue me or something. That should get you off the
hook.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You really think so?&quot; Her look brightened
slightly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, it's me they're worried about, not you. I
represent some threat to them, because of the film I'm making. Just bail out
and you'll be okay.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thanks. I did get the feeling that's all they really
want.&quot; She took another drink of water. &quot;But if they wanted to scare
me, they're doing a hell of a good job.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, then, why not take Kevin and go away for a couple
of weeks? On a vacation someplace? And while you're doing that, I'm going to
have a one-on-one with Alex Goddard. I've got a little leverage now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked at me. &quot;What . . . what are you going to
do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I couldn't tell her about my videotape of his baby cache
without explaining a lot more about Children of Light than I thought she wanted
to hear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't you think the less you know the better?&quot; I
said, taking her hand. &quot;I've caused you enough trouble already.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, I caused myself trouble.&quot; She was getting up.
&quot;Can I use your bathroom?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sure.&quot; I pointed the way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While she was gone, I went to the kitchen and surveyed it,
checking the cabinets. Again, the place was cleaner than it had been in ages.
The look of it momentarily bucked me up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When Carly came back, she hugged me and then an­nounced she
wanted to go check on Kevin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll do what you said about calling them,&quot; she
concluded, reaching for her bag. &quot;I think you're right. That ought to get
them off my case. At least for the moment. As for the long run—“</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Carly,&quot; I said, taking her hand again, &quot;we'll
get through this. Just trust me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We hugged one more time and then she was gone. I took the
moment to double-lock the door, and then collapsed on the couch. What should be
my next move? I closed my eyes and tried to review all the insidious things
that had happened in the last twenty-four hours. The illegal drugs, the
break-in and theft of my film, the suspicious nursery of Children of Light, the
threats to Carly . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then it finally came back that she'd mentioned Ramos saying
something about me. By now I was getting used to being threatened by the man,
so one more time was hardly news. But I wished I'd asked her the specifics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when I roused myself and reached for the phone. The
time was pushing eleven, but I still wanted to check in on Sarah, see how she
was doing. Had she come back to reality after I left?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was listening to the phone ring, my mind drifting to
thoughts of how to gently ask Lou about her, when I realized nobody was picking
up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What's going on? I wondered, immediately coming alert. Mrs.
Reilly had probably gone home for the day, but no way would Lou be in bed
before midnight. He always had trouble settling into sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe, I then hoped, I'd just dialed the wrong number. But
when I tried again, still no answer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I clicked off the phone and felt a wave of concern. If
Colonel Jose Alvino Ramos could find out I was making a movie, and then find
out where I lived, he sure as hell could locate my extended family. Was that what
he'd meant when he mentioned me to Carly?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I grabbed the set of Lou's keys I had stored in my bedroom's
desk drawer and flew out the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The streets were plastered with a grimy veneer of city snow,
melting fast, but I pushed the limits of safety and ran a couple of lights
since the traffic was spotty. There was a parking space just across the street
from Lou's building, and as I pulled in I looked over at his windows.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Through the curtains I could tell a dim light was on,
probably coming from Sarah's bedroom. The front room, how­ever, was dark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My pulse was pounding as I raced up the steps to the street
door. I thought about pushing his bell, but I didn't have the patience. Instead
I just fumbled with the key set till I found the biggest one and shoved it into
the lock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The building had no lobby, just a row of stairs leading up to
the next floor, with Lou's own door set off to the left. I shoved his Medeco
key into the deadlock and pushed it open. The room was pitch-dark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who . . .&quot; said a startled voice, and I knew it
was Lou, somewhere in the direction of the couch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I clicked on the light switch and saw him lying on the floor,
leaning against the couch, blood everywhere, his eyes in shock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My God! What happened?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm afraid to move. The phone was ringing and I figured
it was you, but I didn't dare get up. Knowing you, you'd come over if I didn't
answer.&quot; He was holding his side as he looked at me. &quot;Morgy, she's
gone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At first what he said didn't sink in as I bent over him. The
right side of his shirt, just above his belt, was soaked in blood. Taking care,
I unbuttoned it and saw an open cut that looked as though he'd been stabbed
with a knife. It also appeared to be reasonably superficial, as though a thin
blade had pierced through a couple of layers of tread on his ample spare tire.
But it was bleeding still, enough to make it look worse than it probably was.
However, if it'd happened to me, I'd doubtless be in shock too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I got up, went to the bathroom, and pulled two towels off the
rack, then doused water over one and came back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't move. I'm going to pull your shirt away and try
to clean you up, see how bad it is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He just groaned and stared at the ceiling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I was swabbing his side, what he'd said finally regis­tered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did you say . . . <i>Sarah</i>!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I dropped the towels and ran into the bedroom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was empty, the bed rumpled and beige sheets on the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No.&quot; I turned and feeling a hit of nausea, hurried
back to his side. &quot;What happened? Did—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Fat Hispanic guy. Spic bastard. He had a couple of young
punks with him. Mrs. Reilly had just left and I went to the door, thinking it
was probably you ringing my bell. He flashed a knife and they shoved their way
in. Then one of his thugs went into the bedroom and carried her out. When I
tried to stop them, the SOB knifed me. I guess I . . . swooned cause the next
thing I remember is waking up here on the floor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It sounded garbled and probably didn't occur as quickly</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>as he
thought. But I knew immediately what had happened Ramos—of course that's who it
was—had come to take Sarah. It was his one sure way to stop me from mentioning
Children of Light in my film. She was a hostage. My first instinct was to kill
him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What else can you remember?&quot; I was already dialing
911. Time to get an ambulance. And after that, the cops.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After about ten rings I got somebody and, following an
explanation that was longer than it needed to be, a woman with a southern
accent told me the medics would be there in fifteen minutes. I took another
look at Lou and ordered them to hurry, then hung up. I was going to call the
police next, but first I needed to hear exactly what had happened before he got
quarantined in some emergency room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His eyes were glazing over again, as shock and blood loss
started to catch up with him. Clearly he would pull through, but right now,
sitting there in a pool of blood, he could have been at death's door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look . . . at that.&quot; He was pointing, his
rationality be­ginning to fail. For a second I didn't realize what he meant,
but then I saw a fax lying beside the phone. I picked it up. The time on it was
9:08 P.M. and it was from somebody named John Williams. Then I remembered.
Wasn't that the FBI computer whiz he'd talked about the other day at the
hospital, after we'd deconstructed Sarah's waterlogged pass­port?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was no message, just a sheet with a date—two years
old—and a list of names accompanied by numbers and a capital letter. Then I
noticed the letterhead of Aviateca, the Guatemalan national airline, and it
dawned on me I was look­ing at a flight manifest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I scanned down the page, and then I saw it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sarah Crenshaw, 3B.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Williams found her, I thought. And she was traveling First
Class.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What caught my eye next was the name of the person sitting in
3A, the seat right next to hers. A. Godford. Probably a computer misprint. Or
maybe it was the name he used when he traveled. So if it was him, which it
surely was, the bastard didn't even try to hide it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I just stood there, thinking. Maybe you get one big-time
coincidence in life, and if so, this must be mine. Sarah and I had both found
Alex Goddard. Or he'd found us. Other women came and went through Quetzal
Manor, but we were different. She'd escaped from him, half dead but now he'd
sent Ramos to bring her back. It was the one way he could be sure to keep me under
his control. But again, why? Was it just to stop my film, or was there more to
the story?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgy,&quot; Lou groaned &quot;that son of a bitch took
her to­night. I just know it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was my conclusion precisely, though I hadn't been
planning to say it to him, at least not yet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How can you be so sure?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Something they said. I didn't quite catch it, but it
sounded like, 'He wants you back.' Then some word. It sounded like 'Babylon' or
something.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I stared at him a second trying to remember where I'd heard
that before. Then it clicked in. That was the last thing Sarah had said she'd
whispered that word when I was putting her to bed. What could she have been
talking about?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He wheezed and I went back to him and pressed the towel
against his side. The bleeding was about stemmed but he was definitely due for
a hospital stay. A siren was sounding down the street. Probably the ambulance.
Thank God I thought. Now it's time to call the police.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I noticed he was crying. What was that about?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgy, they didn't actually kidnap her. You see,
she—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;What?&quot; I guess I was trying to take it in. &quot;What do you
mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;Know what she said? Sarah?&quot; He choked for a second, then continued.
&quot;She said, 'Yes, I want to go back.' &quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>efore I could ask him what the hell
he was talking about, the medics were ringing the doorbell. They strode in with
a gurney, also rolling a portable plasma IV, young guys who looked like they'd
be more at home at a Garden hockey game, followed immediately by two uniformed
policemen, actually policewomen, one short and heavy, with reddish hair, the
other a wiry young Hispanic. (I found out that ambulances called out for
stabbing or gunshot wounds automatically get a cop escort.) In less than three
minutes, Lou was in the blue-and-white ambulance and on his way to St.
Vincent's emergency room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I rode in the backseat of the squad car as we followed them
and tried to explain what little I knew of what had happened. It turned out to
be an education in the mindless sticking points of the law.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Long story short: The fact that I hadn't reported the bur­glary
of my apartment that very same day immediately cast doubt on my seriousness as
a truth-seeking citizen; I had no proof the unreported burglary of my apartment
(if, indeed, such had actually occurred) was by some Guatemalan mili­tary
attache named Jose Alvino Ramos; since Lou had never seen Colonel Ramos before
tonight, he couldn't possibly identify him as that burglar either; accusing
diplomats of a crime without ironclad proof was frowned on downtown; and when I
stupidly repeated what Lou had said about Sarah's last words (well, he was
going to tell them sooner or later, it would just come bubbling out at some
point), the whole case that she was kidnapped went into revision mode.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By the time we got to the hospital, I was getting questions
that seemed to imply that maybe it was all a domestic af­fair—like most of
their calls: some spaced-out chick who’d run away once and got brought back and
then, still unstable and crazy, decided to knife her own dad and disappear
again. Now he was understandably covering for her. Happened more than you’d
think.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I kept stressing that Lou was former FBI and not the sort to
invent such a whopper, but this was listened to in skeptical silence. If it was
a kidnapping, they then wondered aloud what was the motive and where were the
demands of the perpetrators? I was ready to start yelling at them by the time
we parked in the Seventh Avenue driveway of the emergency room at St.
Vincent's.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They next made me cool my heels in the waiting room while
they went back to interrogate Lou. They were with him for almost an hour, then
came back to where I was and asked me to read and sign the report they'd
written.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A troubled girl, who had emerged from a coma and ap­parently
was suffering bouts of non-rationality, had disap­peared and her father had
been stabbed but not seriously. He was the only witness to the incident and
claimed she'd been kidnapped. However, the girl had run away once pre­viously,
and there was no physical evidence she'd been taken against her will; in fact,
her father admitted she had declared just the opposite. The whole incident
would be investigated further after he came downtown and made a complete state­ment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not going to sign this.&quot; I handed it back,
fuming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is there anything here that's not factually
correct?&quot; The</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Hispanic cop
was looking me straight in the eye, her expres­sion cold as Alaska.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The question made me seethe. Sarah was probably already on
her way out of the country, and here I was trying to reason with two women who
practically thought she was the crimi­nal. But I knew a lost cause when I saw
one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Forget about it. I want to see Lou.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>An intern was coming out and I snagged him, announced I was
next of kin to a patient, and demanded to be taken through the official door
and into the back. At that moment, the stout cop's radio crackled. They were
being summoned to a Christopher Street gay bar where somebody had just been
knifed in a back room. She looked at me, as though to say, &quot;This sounds
like a real crime,&quot; and then they hurried out for their squad car. Christ!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The intern, a young black guy, led me past a row of gurneys
and into a private room at the rear of the huge space. Lou was bandaged all
around his chest and hooked up to an IV and a monitor. He looked better, but I
wasn't sure he'd be ready for what I was about to tell him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, how're you feeling?&quot; I asked as I walked in,
trying to seem upbeat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Fucking cops.&quot; He was boiling, his face actually
red. &quot;Where do they get them these days? McDonald's rejects?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Easy, don't get your blood pressure up.&quot; I reached
over and touched his brow. It felt like he had a mild temperature. &quot;Let's
all just calm down and try to think rationally.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah, I'm thinking rationally. You saw that fax I got
from Williams.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You think that was Alex Goddard seated next to her,
right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who else? When she was in her moonbeam phase, she must
have heard about him and gone up there and ended up in his clutches. But why
did she let him take her down to—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He told me he has a clinic in Central America. He
called it 'a place of miracles.' And then Colonel Ramos shows up, part of the
Guatemalan diplomatic corps. Put two and two together. That's got to be where
they're taking her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who knows, but I'm going to get the boys downtown to
put out a missing-persons APB nationwide. Gerry'll do it for me if I ask. Fuck
New York's Finest. They ain't gonna do crap anyway.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I listened wondering how to impress my bright idea upon him.
The chances were Ramos was taking Sarah back to Guatemala. Probably right this
minute. For some kind of un­finished business. Or just to hold her there as an
insurance policy that Children of Light would never be mentioned in my picture.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I seriously doubt a missing-persons alert is going to
do any good Lou, because I seriously doubt she's going to be walking the
streets of this country. That bastard Ramos is taking her where he knows he can
hide her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean . . . Jesus.&quot; He stared at me as though
the idea had never crossed his mind. I think he'd just repressed it. &quot;What
are we going to—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The only thing we can do. I'm going down there. I'm
going to go straight down there and locate Alex Goddard.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's an exceptionally lousy thought process.&quot;
His voice seemed to be coming from a great distance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why? Give me one good reason why. You think the police
down there are going to bring charges against a colonel?&quot; I really could
have used some encouragement. &quot;It's the only way—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgan, you've always been high-strung.&quot; He sighed
and then winced. &quot;Ever since you were a kid. I worried about you then and
I'm worried about you now. I don't want you to go down there and get into
trouble. Because believe me, that's a seriously wrong place to get crossways
with the pricks who make the rules. You don't know your way around that Third
World craphole. Wouldn't be that hard to end up a statistic. We can alert the
embassy. Have them start looking for her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Listen, there's a lot more going on between Alex God­dard
and me than you know.&quot; This was definitely not the time to tell him about
the babies, or about Carly and the threats. &quot;Trust me. I'm going down
there. In the morning, if I can. Who knows? Sarah and Ramos might even be on
the same plane.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I was finishing that pronouncement, two nurses came in
rolling a gurney and announced that his room was ready. Then they gave him a
sedative.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was I being irrational? The thing was, though, what would you
do? I was absolutely sure Ramos had taken her. So it was obvious that was where
he would go next. He was a &quot;diplomat,&quot; apparently, so he could easily
fudge the passport formalities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the nurses were helping Lou onto the gurney, I stood there
holding his hand and thinking about what lay ahead. Steve was in Belize and
maybe not even reachable, but I decided to start by giving him a call the
minute I got home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then a middle-aged WASP, with dark hair, slightly bal­ding,
strode in the room. The photo ID on his chest read &quot;Dr. M. Summers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So, how's the patient?&quot; he enquired cheerily,
ignoring me as he immediately began checking the chart at the foot of Lou's
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Felt better,&quot; Lou said, not being taken in by his
pro forma cheer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, we're going to make sure you get a good night's
rest.&quot; Dr. Summers finished with the chart and started taking his pulse.
&quot;What's left of it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How long am I going to be in here, Doc?&quot; Lou
asked, flinching as the nurses removed the IV stuck in his arm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A couple of days. For observation. To make sure
there're no complications.&quot; He smiled again. &quot;You're a lucky man, Mr.
. . . Crenshaw. Just a superficial cut. But we don't want you out playing
handball for a few days.&quot; He turned and gave me a conspiratorial wink,
then glanced back. &quot;Okay, up we go.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Can I come with him?&quot; I asked, not optimistic but
hop­ing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The doctor looked genuinely contrite. &quot;I'm really sorry,
but he's going to be fine and visiting hours are long past. You can call in the
morning. And you can come up anytime after two P.M. tomorrow. Let's let him get
some rest now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I walked around and took Lou's hand, hot and fevered, feeling
so agitated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't think about anything tonight, okay? Worrying
won't help. Just get some sleep. I'm going to find her, I promise you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't—&quot; He mumbled some words, but I think the
seda­tive the nurses had given him was seriously starting to kick</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, you can call down to 26 Federal Plaza tomorrow.
See what they can do. In the meantime, let me follow my nose.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He tried to answer, but he was too far gone. I then watched
wistfully as he disappeared down the sterile alley of beds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After I stopped by the desk and helped them fill out the
insurance forms, I caught a cab downtown to retrieve my Toyota. The time was
now two-fifteen in the morning, but I still had plenty to do. When I got home,
the first thing I did after I walked in the door was grab a phone book and call
American Airlines. They had a flight, in the morning at nine-thirty. I gave
them my credit card specifics and made a res­ervation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I no longer thought that Alex Goddard's Children of Light and
its Guatemalan accomplices were merely doing some­thing shady. My hunch now was
that it was completely ille­gal. They were getting hundreds of white babies in
some way that couldn't bear the light of day, and they were prepared to do
whatever it took to prevent me from highlighting them in my film. And with the
Army involved, and now Sarah taken, their game was beginning to feel more and
more like kidnapping. They certainly knew how.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sarah had become a pawn, and all because of me. I almost
wondered if I'd been unconsciously led to him by her, though that was
impossible. Whatever had happened, the remorse I now felt was overpowering. It
was, in fact, an intensified version of the guilt that had dogged me for the
past fifteen years, the horrible feeling I'd somehow let her down, not done
enough for her. I could have flown back for her high school graduation, but I
was cramming for grad school finals and didn't take the time. Things like that,
which, looking back, seemed terribly selfish. And now I'd brought this on her.
God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay, I thought, glancing at the clock, time to start making
it up to her. Screw up your courage and wake Steve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The problem was, Lou had been right about one thing. It'd
been years since I'd been to Guatemala, and I wasn't sure I knew beans about
how things operated down there these days. I was high on motivation and only
so-so in the area of modus operandi. I needed Steve's help in plying the tricky
waters of that part of the planet. He was busy, but this was definitely
&quot;us against the world&quot; time, so maybe he could drive over to Guatemala
City and help.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I picked up the phone again and punched in the number of his
hotel in Belize City, which seemed to be embedded permanently in my brain. That
wonderful accent at the desk mon, and then they were ringing his room. I had no
reason on earth to assume he would be there, but . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The click, the voice, it was him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sorry to call so late, love. You said you missed me, so
I've decided to find out if it's true. Your coming attraction is about to
arrive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I guess I was trying to keep it flip. After our talk that
morning, I wasn't entirely sure where we stood anymore.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who . . . Morgy, is that you? God it's two . . . Are
you okay?&quot; Then he started coming around, processing what I said.
&quot;You're coming . . . Honey, that's great.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I noted before, he always knew how to give a good reading,
sound sincere, no matter what the occasion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Actually, I've just made a plane reservation, and I'm
going to be in Guatemala City tomorrow, just after noon.&quot; I hesitated then
thought, why beat around the bush? &quot;Care to meet me there?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's terrific,&quot; he declared coming fully awake.
&quot;But why don't you just come to Belize City? Can't you get flight? It's
actually not nearly as wild here as the travel books—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I've . . . Look, I'd rather not talk about this
on the phone. But do you think you could get free and drive over I really could
use your help. I've got a situation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well . . .&quot; He paused. &quot;I could be there by
late tomorrow assuming my rented Jeep still operates after last week and the
roads haven't totally disintegrated. Where're you going to be staying?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know. Got any suggestions? I want to keep out
of the limelight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then try the Camino Real. It's like a Holiday Inn with
plastic palm trees. Definitely low maintenance and low profile. Hang on, I'll
get you the number.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which he did, though I could hear him stumbling around the
room in the dark. Then he continued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But listen, here's the bad news. I've got to be back
here day after tomorrow. I just got a special permit to do some night shooting
in the jaguar preserve down by Victoria Peak—you remember the rain forest I
told you about?—but it's only good for one night, and I hear rumors there's an
off-season hurricane forming in the Caribbean, which means I've got to stick to
schedule. After that, though, I'm free again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We'll work it out.&quot; I was thrilled he would just
drop everything and come. Maybe we were over the rough spot about the baby.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He didn't bring that up and I didn't either. Instead we
killed a few minutes, and then I let him go back to sleep. I wanted to say I
love you, but I didn't want to push my luck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After that I called the hotel he'd recommended. The ex­change
was more Spanish than English, but they had a room. Apparently lots of rooms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next I rang Paula Marks, even though it was terribly late.
She must have had the phones off, but I left a message telling her to be
careful, with a postscript that I'd explain everything later. Just stick close
to home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally I called David's voice mail up at Applecore. I told
him I had a personal crisis and was going to Guatemala City. I'd try to be back
by the end of the week, hell or high water, but no guarantees. And if he
touched so much as a frame of my work print while I was gone, I'd personally
strangle him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I don't remember much of what happened next. I basically went
on autopilot. It's as though I dropped into a trance, totally focused. I packed
my passport, a good business suit, the tailored blue one, and also a set of
mix-and-match sepa­rates, easy to roll and cram in. Finally a couple of pairs
of good (clean) jeans, a few toiletries, and then, thinking ahead, I also threw
in my yellow plastic flashlight. I almost always over pack, but not this time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Oh, and one other thing. For airplane reading I grabbed a
Lonely Planet guide to Central America that Steve had left behind—I guess he
figured he was at the stage of life to start writing them, not reading
them—that turned out to be very helpful, particularly the map of Guatemala City
and the northern Peten rain forest. I then collapsed and—images of Sarah's
emaciated face haunting my consciousness—caught a couple of hours' sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The next thing I knew, it was 9:20 A.M. and I was settling
into window seat 29F on American Airlines Flight 377—next to a
two-hundred-pound executive busy ripping articles out of the business section
of <i>El Diario</i>—headed for Guatemala City.</span></p>

<h2><a name=bookmark17>Chapter Fifteen</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='color:windowtext'>F</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>or once in my life, I took my time
getting off an airplane. But the instant I felt that first burst of humid
tropical air against my face, like a gush from a sauna, I found myself
wondering what Sarah had felt the moment her feet first touched the ground of
Guatemala. In fact, I'd decided to try to think like her, to better understand
why she might want to come back. Truthfully I didn't have a clue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But first things first. Not knowing whether I was being
stalked by Ramos or his proxies, I decided the idea was to see and not be
seen—which actually was easier than I'd ex­pected, at least during the initial
pell-mell stages. Turned out the self-centeredness of Homo sapiens blossoms
under those circumstances. Ignore thy neighbor, goes the credo. I just buried
myself in the crush.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I got to &quot;Inmigracion,&quot; I labored through the
&quot;for­malities&quot; (as all countries love to call the suspicious looks
you get from their airport bureaucrats) along with all the other gringo
passengers on AA Flight 377, paranoid I might be arrested on the spot for some
spurious reason. The pur­pose of my visit, I declared, was tourism. Just a nod
at my passport and a stamp, which looked exactly like the one in Sarah's. I
stared at it and felt a renewed sense of purpose. In fact, the photo in my
passport looked more than a little like her. Maybe, I thought, I'm getting
carried away with the identity issue, but there it was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I emerged through the wide glass doors of the arrival
area, which fronted out onto the steps leading down to the parking lots and the
humidity, I spotted a black Land Rover with tinted windows right in front.
Uh-oh. That was, Steve once told me, a vehicle much favored by the notorious
Guatemalan G-2 military secret police, who had retired the cup for murderous
human-rights abuses over the past two decades.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then two middle-aged men with Latin mustaches and nondescript
brown shirts began getting out through the door on the far side. They next
walked around to the terminal side of the car and glanced up the steps in my
direction, as though looking for somebody. It was a quick survey, after which
they turned back and nodded to the vehicle before it sped away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What's that about? Am I imagining things already?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By the time I reached the bottom of the steps, I was being
besieged by clamoring cabbies, so it was difficult to keep an eye on the two
men, who were now walking off to the side of the main commotion, toward a shady
grove of palms at the end of the arrival drive, lighting cigarettes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Get out of here. Whether you're fantasizing or not, the thing
to do is grab an unsuspecting cab and get going.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I strolled toward the other end of the long row of concrete
steps till I reached an area where cabs were parked, more drivers lurking in
wait. They all looked the same way most cabbies in Third World lands look:
shabby clothes, with beat-up cars, an expression in their eyes somewhere
between ag­gression and desperation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just pick one whose car looks like it might actually make it
to downtown.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I spotted a dark blue Chevy that seemed clean and well
maintained, its driver young and full of male hormones as he beckoned me to his
vehicle, all the while undressing me with his eyes. Yep, he was definitely my
guy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I ambled by his car, acting as though I was ignoring the
innuendos of his pitch. Then I bolted for the back door, opened it myself since
he was too startled to help, threw in my carry-ons, piled in behind them, and
yelled, &quot;Let's go. Rapido.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As we sped away, I realized his greatest surprise was that I
hadn't raised the subject of price. At that point, it was the last thing on my
mind. I looked back to see the two guys from the black Land Rover, together
with two others, heading for a car that had been double-parked right in front.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Had I been right after all?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We made a high-speed turn onto the highway, and I immediately
ordered the driver to take a service road that led off toward a cluster of gas
stations and parking lots with falling-down barbed-wire fences. I figured I had
about half a minute of lead time, whatever was going on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We dodged massive potholes and the loose gravel flew, but
then we reached a ramshackle gas station and I ordered him to pull in. Then I
watched the line of traffic speeding by on the main highway for several
minutes. Nobody pulled off. Good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My driver finally got around to asking where I wanted to go,
and as calmly as I could, I told him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Palacio Nacional.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Si</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>With that he gunned his engine and spun out. Jesus!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Mas despacio, por favor</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Okay,&quot; he said, showing off his English
as he donned his sunglasses. &quot;I go more slow. No problem.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The initial destination was part of my new plan, hatched
while I was on the plane. When I was reading my guidebook and filling out my
entry card I'd had a bright idea. I knew exactly how I wanted to begin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Heading into town, the time now the middle of the after­noon,
I leaned back in the seat and tried to absorb the view, to get a feeling for
where I was. We first traveled through the suburban fringes, the heavily
guarded luxurious man­sions of the landholding and military elite, the one
percent of Guatemala who own ninety-nine percent of the country. Iron fences
and wide expanses of lawn, protected by Uzi-toting security, guarded whimsical
architectural con­ceits topped by silver satellite dishes. A twenty-foot wall
shielded their delicate eyes from the city's largest shanty-town, makeshift
hovels of bamboo and rusted tin, with no signs of water or drains or toilets.
Guatemala City: as Steve had put it once, a million doomed citizens, the rich
and the poor, trapped together side by side in the most &quot;modern&quot;
capital in Central America.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why on earth had Sarah decided to come here? Even if she did
travel with the mesmerizing Alex Goddard it was hard to imagine a place less
spiritual. Couldn't she feel that this was all wrong? One of us had to be
missing something major.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Fifteen minutes later I was passing through the fetid
atmosphere of downtown, which seemed to be another world, Guatemala City's twin
soul. It was an urban hodgepodge of Burger King, McDonald's, discount
electronics emporia, an eye-numbing profusion of plastic signs, filthy parking
lots, rattletrap buses and taxis, stalled traffic. Exhaust fumes thickened the
air, and everywhere you looked teenage &quot;guards&quot; in uniforms loitered
in front of stores and banks with sawed-off shotguns, boys so green and
scared-looking you'd think twice about letting one of them park your car. But
there they were, weapons at the ready, nervously moni­toring passersby. Who
were they defending all the wealth from? The ragged street children, with
swollen bellies and skin disease, vending single cigarettes from open packs? Or
the hordes of widows and orphans, beneficiaries of the Army's Mayan &quot;pacification&quot;
program, who now begged for centavos or plaintively hawked half-rotten fruit
from the safety of the shadows?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My bright-idea destination was a government office in the
Palacio Nacional, right in the center of town, where I hoped I could find Sarah's
old landing card, the record of when tourists arrived and departed. When I'd
filled mine out on the plane, I'd realized you were supposed to put down where
you'd be staying in Guatemala. I figured the best way to locate her this time
was to find out where she went last time. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As my cab pulled up in front, a black Land Rover was parked
in a &quot;Prohibido Estacionarse&quot; zone by the front steps. To my eyes it
looked like the same one I'd seen at the airport. Shit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But nobody was around, so I decided maybe I was just being
paranoid again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Palacio turned out to be a mixture of Moorish and faux
Greek architecture, with a facade of light green imita­tion stone that gave off
the impression of a large, rococo wedding cake. I took a long look, paid off
the driver—who had turned out to be very nice—and headed in. It was, after all,
a public building, open to tourist gringos.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nobody in the lobby appeared to take any particular notice of
me, so after going through their very serious security, uniforms and guns everywhere,
I checked the directory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It turned out the president, cabinet ministers, and high
military officers all kept offices there, but it didn't take long to find the
bureau I was looking for. Going down the mar­ble-floored hallway on the third
floor, I passed by the Sala de Recepcion, a vast wood-paneled room of enormous
chandeliers, stained-glass windows, and a massive coat of arms. Quite a place,
but not my destination. At the far end of the hallway, I found the door I
wanted, went in, and tried out the Spanish question I'd been practicing in the
cab. Not neces­sary: English worked fine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Senora</i>, the records for that time were only kept
on pa­per,&quot; a Ladino woman declared shrugging, her nails colored a brash
mauve, her hair a burst of red, &quot;but you are welcome to look.&quot; She'd
been on the phone, chatting in rapid-fire Spanish, but she quickly hung up and
got out her glasses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thanks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The welcome mat was obviously a little thin. The woman was
trying to be friendly, but very quickly her nervousness began to come through.
&quot;We're always glad to accommodate Americans searching for friends or
relatives,&quot; she went on, attempting a smile. &quot;Some of your American
press has been printing distortions, that the Guatemalan Army conspired with
the CIA to cover up murders. It's a total lie.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Right. Maybe you ought to see some of the photos Steve has of
the &quot;Army-pacified&quot; Maya villages up in the moun­tains.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The search took an hour and a half of leafing through dusty
boxes, which chafed my hands raw, but then . . . voila.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There it was. The crucial piece of information Lou had
missed. A hastily scribbled-in landing card for an American, with the name
Sarah Crenshaw. I stared at it a moment, feel­ing a glow of success. Was it an
omen?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was definitely her. She'd even dotted an &quot;i&quot;
with a smiley face, one of her personal trademarks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I looked down the form. What I wanted was the address
she'd put down as a destination in Guatemala.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The answer: &quot;Ninos del Mundo, Peten Department.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My hopes sank. Great. That was like saying your address</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>is Children
of the World, lost somewhere in the state of Mon­tana.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The home address was equally vague. Just &quot;New
York.&quot; So much for the high level of curiosity at &quot;Inmigracion.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>However, the carbon copy of the landing card, which you're
supposed to surrender when you leave, was not sta­pled to it, the way it was on
all the others in the box. Natu­rally, since she'd left in a medevac plane,
half dead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What does this mean?&quot; I got up and walked over to
the woman's desk, carrying the card. Mainly I just wanted to get a rise out of
her. &quot;The carbon copy is missing. Does that mean she could still be
here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Red alert. She glanced at the arrival date a moment and her
eyes froze. Then, doubtless with visions of another CIA scandal looming in her
consciousness, she brusquely an­nounced that the office was getting ready to
close for the day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'll have to pursue any further inquiries through the
American embassy, Mrs. James, which handles all matters concerning U.S.
nationals.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, thanks for all your help.&quot; I was finally
getting the police-state runaround I'd expected all along. I guess I needed her
to care, and it was obvious she didn't.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay . . . I'd planned to go to the embassy anyway. Maybe
they could tell me about this place she'd put on her landing card. Could it be
the local name for Alex Goddard's clinic?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I picked up my things, I thought again about the pros­pect
of showing my face on the streets of Guatemala City. Would there be more
loitering men in grungy brown shirts waiting to watch my every move? More black
Land Rovers? As I marched back out through the ornate lobby, I decided not to
let my imagination get too active. It was now late afternoon, but I was making
progress. I also was thinking about Steve, wondering if he'd gotten into town
yet. Probably not for another couple of hours, but just thinking about see­ing
him again, and having him for support, was boosting my energy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A short cab ride later I arrived at the embassy of the all-
powerful United States of America, a two-block-long con­crete fortress on
Reforma Avenue guarded by Yank Marines with heavy automatic weapons. When I
explained myself to the PR people manning the reception desk, including my
brush with Guatemalan bureaucracy, they told me to check with the Internal
Security section.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In fact, if you're looking for an American national,
this is where you should have come in the first place,&quot; said a very
efficient-appearing young woman, with a business suit and dark, close-cropped
hair. &quot;A phone call from here works wonders at the Palacio Nacional.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I had no proof Sarah was in Guatemala yet, and if she was, it
would doubtless be under a different name. What's more, telling them my
suspicion that she'd been kidnapped by a high official and brought here would
definitely brand me as a conspiracy theorist. So for now, all I could really
hope to get from them was an address for Alex Goddard's clinic, someplace to
start. Where and what was &quot;Ninos del Mundo&quot;? Apparently the woman
hadn't fully understood that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Moments later a thirtyish male attache showed up, looking
very harried. He also could have been president of the local Young Republicans,
with a cute haircut and preppie tie, knot­ted perfectly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi, I'm Mel Olberg. How can I . . .?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I told him I wanted to see someone who was responsible for
the records of missing American tourists. I also sensed he was edgy and trying
to get it over with fast; all the while he kept checking his watch, only half
listening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Gee, I really wish you'd come earlier,&quot; he said.
&quot;Monday</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>afternoons
are a little nuts around here, weekly reports due and all, and it's getting
late.&quot; When he glanced at his watch again, making sure I noticed, I found
myself wanting to yell at the guy. &quot;I mean it's been two years since this
woman you're looking for filled out a landing card. We might have something in
the files, but. . . would it be possible for you to come back tomorrow?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, it will not be possible,&quot; I lied. &quot;I've
got a plane back to New York tomorrow.&quot; I felt my frustration rising. I
wanted to just grab him and shake him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My first thought was to tell him I make documentary films and
maybe he'd like to end up in one about how my country's Guatemala City embassy
didn't care about its citizens. But then I decided to go in a different,
probably more productive, direction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just for five minutes,&quot; I declared, reaching for
feigned helplessness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, let me call upstairs,&quot; he muttered,
realizing, I sup­pose, that the best way to get rid of me was to kick me up the
chain of command, &quot;and see if Mr. Morton can take a moment to meet with
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It worked. The next thing I knew, I was in the office of a
good-looking diplomat named Barry Morton—gray temples, tailored suit, rugged
face of a sixty-year-old soap-opera heartthrob who plays tennis and keeps a
mistress. Chief In­formation Officer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Actually, I do remember her, vaguely,&quot; Morton
declared, flashing me his professional smile. &quot;The Crenshaw girl was an
unfortunate case. To begin with, anybody who overstays their visa that long
gets us in a lot of hot water with the locals. They always tend to blame us,
Ms. . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;James. My name's Morgan James.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ms. James.&quot; Another of those smiles.
&quot;Frankly, I don't know what to tell you, though.&quot; He shrugged,
exuding helplessness. &quot;It's hard to keep track of every American tourist
who comes and goes through this country. Some of the hippie types end up in a
mountain village somewhere, gone native. In this instance, as I recall, we got
her out on a medevac.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Her landing card gave her destination as someplace
called 'Ninos del Mundo,' up to the Peten. That ring a bell? Any idea how I
could find it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Niiios del Mundo?&quot; He glanced up quickly.
&quot;That's a new one on me.&quot; He'd been fiddling with a stack of papers
on his desk, giving me only half his attention, but he abruptly stopped.
&quot;You try the phone book?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Like I said, it's in the Peten.&quot; I was getting the
definite sense he wanted to get rid of me as soon as possible. The whole scene
was feeling tense and off. &quot;My understanding is that's mostly rain forest.
Do they even have phones up there?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not many,&quot; he said, his tone starting to
definitely acquire an &quot;I have better things to do&quot; edge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when he focused in on me, his look turning
protective.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me speak candidly, Ms. James, strictly off the
record. Down here people have been known to 'disappear' just for asking too
many questions. Curiosity killed the cat, and all that. Between us, this place
is still a police state in many regards. You want my advice, let sleeping dogs
lie. Just forget about this Crenshaw girl. She's out of the country now, so . .
. Let me put it like this: People who go poking around here are just asking for
trouble.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I felt a ring of sincerity in his voice. Maybe a little too
much sincerity. Why was he so worried for me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That may be true, but I'm still going to see what I can
find out. My heart is pure. Why should anybody care?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do what you think best,&quot; he said with a sigh,
&quot;but I've told you everything we know. Which, I'm afraid, is actually very
little.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;By the way.&quot; Try one more thing on him, I thought,
see what he'll say. &quot;Since you're so concerned about Sarah, you'll be
relieved to know she's regained consciousness and started to talk.&quot; There
seemed no point in telling him any more. The rest was all still speculation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That stopped him cold. &quot;What . . . what has she
said?&quot; His eyes appeared startled in the glaring light of the office
fluorescents. At long last I had his undivided attention.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're busy.&quot; I smiled at him. &quot;I don't want
to bore you with details. But it's just going to be a matter of time before she
remembers exactly what happened down here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She hasn't talked about it yet?&quot; He was fiddling
with an ornate letter opener, an onyx jaguar head on the handle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She's getting there.&quot; I stared back at him, trying
to read his mood. &quot;We may soon find out who was behind whatever happened
to her.&quot; Then I tried a long shot. &quot;Maybe official­dom here had
something to do with it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me tell you something.&quot; He sighed again,
seeming to regain his composure. &quot;The sovereign state of Guatemala
definitely plays by its own rules. Whenever foreigners down here meet with foul
play, lower-level officials have developed a consensus over the years that
sometimes it's better not be too industrious. Nobody's ever sure of what, or
who, they might turn up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The meeting was definitely ending, and once again I had more
questions than answers. Something about Barry Mor­ton felt wrong, but I
couldn't quite get a grip on what it was. One thing I was certain of: He knew
more than he was telling me. Why was that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I was exiting through his outer office, headed for the
swarming streets below, I waved good-bye to his secretary, a stout, fiftyish
Ladino matron with defiantly black-dyed hair, a hard look mitigated somewhat by
the Zircon trim on her thick glasses and a small silver pendant nestled on her
ample, low-cut sweater. It was the pendant that caught my eye, being the silver
face of a cat, most likely the local jaguar. Looked just like the ones I'd seen
you-know-where. I was staring so hard I almost stumbled over a chair. Yes. It
was definitely like those I remembered from Kevin and Rachel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The only difference was, when she bent over to reach for her
stapler, the medallion twisted around and the back, I could see, flashed blank
silver, no engraving of lines and dots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So where did she get it? I started to ask her, but decided
I'd just get more BS runaround. Then I had another thought: Maybe she handled a
lot of things that never made it to Barry Morton's desk, the &quot;don't waste
the boss's valuable time&quot; kind of secretary. Maybe she s the one I really
should have been talking to, the kind of woman who takes care of every­thing
while the high-paid senior supervisor is at long lunches.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked at me, and our eyes met and held for a second. Had
she been listening in on my chat with Morton? Did she know something I ought to
know?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By then, however, thoughts of Steve were weighing in. I
hadn't seen him in three and a half months and I was realizing that was about
my limit. I wanted to recapture the lost time. Our being together was going to
make everything turn out right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Clinging to that thought, I grabbed a cab and headed for my
hotel and a much-overdue hot bath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<h2><a name=bookmark18>Chapter Sixteen</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;</span><b><span style='color:windowtext'>C</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>ome here,&quot; he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Whoosh. There he was. He strode through the door,
tan safari shirt, smelling like a man who’d just driven hundreds of miles
through Central America in an open Jeep. I wanted to undress him with my teeth
and lick off the sweat. Brown eyes, skin tan as leather, he threw his arms
around me and I felt the weight of the world slip away. He was here. I was
wearing a robe, fresh from the tub, but it was gone in a second. Steve, I gotta
say, knew a thing or two about the bedroom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As we wound ourselves together for the next two hours, I had
a refresher course in how much Id missed him, soul and body. His taste, his
skin, his touch. Finally, we were both so exhausted we just lay there bathed in
sweat, spooned to­gether on the sagging bed. I hadn't felt so good in years. It
was like another world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;God I've missed you,&quot; I said again, holding him
closer. The air-conditioning was beginning to lose ground against the late sun,
but I didn't care. After my solo nightmare of the last two days, I was
remembering what it was like to be a couple again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Camino Real, by the way, turned out to be an American-style
hideaway with budget shag carpeting and flaking blue walls. In a way, though,
the downtrodden decor actually made it more romantic, like we'd sneaked off to
a garish hot-sheet motel for a twilight rendezvous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I finally dragged myself up and got us a bottle of water.
Then, leaning against the rickety headboard, I recounted an abbreviated version
of what had happened yesterday after we'd first talked—the theft of my film,
and then Lou being assaulted and Sarah taken, apparently willingly, to be brought
(I strongly suspected) back here. What I held out on were the details about a
certain Colonel Jose Alvino Ramos, my belief that he was behind the crimes and
in league with Alex Goddard and stalking me. I was afraid our room was bugged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgy, we'll get through this,&quot; he said, reaching
over to stroke my hair. &quot;If somebody brought her back down here, we'll
find her. And I apologize for being such a shit on the phone, about the baby.
I'd just had a local lab lose three rolls of high-speed Kodachrome and I was
seriously frosted at the world. We can keep trying if you want to.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just hold me.&quot; I put down my glass and I reached
around and ran my finger across his chest. It was so lovely to be this close to
somebody you wanted so much. I loved his earnest brown eyes and his soft skin.
I loved him. Just having him with me made such a difference.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The unexpected part was, I'd asked him to come and help me,
but now that he was here, I was starting to feel uneasy about luring him into
my personal nightmare. Was that really fair?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Also, I was getting hints he had problems of his own. The
photo book, I gathered, was not coming together the way he'd hoped. He'd
mumbled something about finding himself torn between a heartstrings essay about
the children (his spe­cialty; you've probably seen his work, whether you know
it or not), a devastating portrayal of the latest crop of sleazy politicos, or
a nature valentine to the vanishing rain forest. But whenever he agonized about
his work, I knew enough to keep my mouth shut and just listen. He didn't want
bright ideas; he just wanted me to clam up and be there for him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Anyway, I knew he'd think his way through the problem. He had
a deceptive air of vulnerability that always disappeared in a crunch. He was
the master of ad hoc solutions. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment, he reached for his watch, studied it, and
abruptly bolted straight up. &quot;Hey, I almost forgot my surprise. I hope
you're still up for it. Did you know this is our anniver­sary? It was on this
very day I first watched you dive into that grungy swimming pool at the
Oloffson in Port-au-Prince.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My God you're right. I'm humiliated.&quot; I hugged him
contritely, feeling like a self-centered twit. I guess I was too focused on
Sarah. (I screw up a lot on birthdays too, always with an excuse.) &quot;I
don't even have a present for you. I've been so—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's okay.&quot; He grinned then stood up and headed
for the shower. &quot;Not the first time. But I've got one for both of us.
We'll make it a gift to each other. It'll help start you thinking like a <i>guatemalteco</i>
insider.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;What? You sneak. What did you get?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A trip back into the void of prehistoric time,&quot; he
yelled over his shoulder. &quot;I am the possessor of a little-known secret
about this town. I called from Belize City this morning and made dinner reservations
for us downtown. You'll see.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>God I loved this man. But the last thing on my mind at that
moment was food.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Honey, I don't know if I'm really—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, don't wimp out on me. If we're going to do this
place, at least we can do it in style. Besides, you can't live on smog alone.
You gotta eat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had a point. Starving myself wasn't going to help find
Sarah any sooner. And there were details I wanted to tell him that I didn't
want to broadcast in the room. What if Colonel Ramos had long ears to match his
long arm?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come on,&quot; he pressed. &quot;Just put on the
slinkiest thing</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>you've got
and get ready to go native. It'll help you put this part of the world into
perspective.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alas, I had nothing particularly &quot;slinky,&quot; though
fortu­nately I'd packed a silk blouse I could loosen and tie with a scarf
around the waist. Don't laugh, it worked. I even brushed on some serious eye
shadow, which normally I don't bother with much.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I tried not to let him know how concerned I was as we walked
down the driveway of the hotel and hailed a cab, while I furtively searched the
shadows. Seeing the streets after dark made me sad all over again for Sarah. I
still wanted to see and feel Guatemala the way she had, but when I got close to
the realities of the place, it made me uneasy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It turned out the marvel he'd discovered was called
Siriaco's, a wonderful old place with a patio and garden in back—both roofed by
glittering tropical stars—which were down a stone pathway from the main dining
room and bar. It appeared to be where a lot of VIPs, the ruling oligarchy,
dined. It was romantic and perfect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When we arrived, his special anniversary surprise was already
being laid out on a low stone table, attended by Mayan women all in traditional
dress: the colorful <i>huipil </i>blouses of their villages, red and blue
skirts, immense jade earrings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They've reconstructed a kingly feast from old docu­ments,&quot;
he explained, beaming at my amazement. &quot;Cuisine of the ancient rain
forest. We're going to have a banquet of authentic <i>guatemalteco</i> chow
from eons ago.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>And the meal was definitely fit for royalty. Soon we
were working our way through a long-forgotten medley of piquant flavors that
swept through my senses as though I were in another world. There was
pit-roasted deer, steamed fish, baked wild turkey. One calabash bowl set forth
coriander-flavored kidney beans; another had half a dozen varieties of green
legumes all in a rich turtle broth; a third offered va­nilla-seasoned sweet
potatoes; others had various forest tu­bers steamed with chiles. We even had a
delicious honey wine, like heavenly nectar, served in red clay bowls, that made
me want to have sex right on the table. There with Steve, the unexpected
juxtaposition of spices and flavors made every bite, every aroma, a new sensual
experience. (Let me say right here he's a cooking fanatic, whereas I've been
known to burn water. I think it's the new division of labor in post-feminist
America.) Finally the Mayan waitresses brought out cups of a chocolate dessert
drink from ancient times, cocoa beans roasted, ground, and boiled with
sugarcane. The whole event was pure heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Except for the occasional unwanted intrusions. Various
dark-eyed low-cut Ladino divorcees, about half a dozen in all, hanging out at
the bar with heavy perfume and too much jewelry, kept coming over purportedly
to marvel over our private feast (or was it Steve's big brown eyes). He
returned their attentions with his polite and perfect Spanish, but I despised
them. In any case, they were shameless. Not re­membering quite enough Espanol,
however, the best I could do was just to put my hand on his and give them the
evil eye. It seemed to work, though what I really wanted to do was hold up a
cross the way you do to ward off vampires. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, check out Orion,&quot; he said finally leaning back,
an easy, delicious finger aimed at that sprawling constellation. I looked up at
the canopy of stars, and sure enough, the hunter and his sword dominated the
starry sky above like a stalwart centurion, guarding us. &quot;I always know
I'm in the tropics when it's right overhead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Honey, this has been wonderful,&quot; I declared.
&quot;Thank you so much.&quot; I moved around and kissed him. &quot;It's
exactly the attitude adjustment I needed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well&quot;—he smiled back—&quot;now I guess we've got
some</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>organizing
to do. So tell me everything you left out back there at the hotel. I know you
were holding off.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was feeling increasingly hyper, probably from the high-
octane chocolate, but I proceeded to recount all my findings about Alex Goddard
and Quetzal Manor. Then I moved on to Colonel Ramos and how he'd threatened
Carly and me about my film. Finally, I told him my deep belief that Colonel
Ramos and a couple of his goons were obviously the ones who'd roughed up Lou
and taken Sarah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bad scene,&quot; he said when I finally paused for
breath. He was toying with his cup and running his fingers through his sandy
hair, in that &quot;deep thought&quot; mode of his. &quot;Way I see it, this
just sounds like a classic case of selling kids. To me, that's right up there
with murder and grand larceny.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I also firmly believe it's all tied in with Alex
God­dard's clinic here, or whatever it is. The place Sarah called Ninos del
Mundo on her landing card. I'll bet you anything that's where Ramos has taken
her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know,&quot; he said, his brow a perfect furrow,
eyes nar­rowed, &quot;about the babies you saw, there've been press stories
over the last few years about Americans being attacked in Guatemala on
suspicion of trying to kidnap Maya children out in the villages, to put up for
adoption. But I've never seen any proof of it. I've always thought it just
might have been dumb gringos who don't know the culture. They go poking around
out in the countryside and stupidly say the wrong thing. Maybe using schoolbook
Spanish nobody out there re­ally understands. But now this makes me wonder
if—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Love, those babies I saw up at Quetzal Manor are not
kidnapped Indian children, trust me. They're Caucasian as vanilla snow cones.
Try again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I get your point,&quot; he said quickly. &quot;But let
me relate the facts of life down here. When you've got some Guatemalan colonel
behind something, you'd better think twice about how many rocks you turn
over.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Funny, but that's exactly what some guy at the embassy
named Barry Morton said to me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And you'd better listen. This is the country that
turned the word 'disappear' into a new kind of verb. People get 'disappeared.'
I actually knew some of them, back in the late eighties. One dark night an Army
truck rolls into a village, and when the torture and . . . other things are
over with, a few Maya are never heard from again.&quot; He looked at me.
&quot;You saw my pictures of that village in the Huehuetenango Department,
Tzalala, where the Army mutilated and mur­dered half the—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I know all about that.&quot; It was chilling to recall
his grue­some photos. &quot;But I'm going to track down Alex Goddard's clinic,
no matter what. That's where they've taken Sarah, I'm sure of it. I just may
need some help finding it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He grimaced. &quot;Damn, I've got to head back to Belize by
noon tomorrow.&quot; Then his look brightened. &quot;But, hey, I fin­ish my
shoot Wednesday, so I can drive back here on Thurs­day. Then on Friday maybe we
could—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come on, love, I can't just sit around till the end of
the week. What am I going to do till then?&quot; The very thought made me
itchy. &quot;I need to find out if Ninos del Mundo, the place Sarah put on her
original landing card is for real. Her card said it's somewhere in the Peten,
the rain forest. If I could find somebody who—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, look.&quot; He was thinking aloud. &quot;How
about this? There's a guy here in town who owes me a favor. A big one. He
screwed me out of twenty grand in the U.S. We were going to start a travel
magazine—I think I told you about that—but then he took my money and split the
country. He ended up down here and went to work for the CIA—till they sacked him.
After that he leased a helicopter and started some kind of bullshit tourist
hustle. He sure as hell knows what's going on. Name's Alan Dupre. The prick.
Maybe I could give him a call and we could get together for a late drink. He's
got an easy number these days: 4-MAYAN.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How's he going to help?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Trust me. He's our guy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I leaned back and closed my eyes, my imagination drifting. In
that brief moment, my mind floated back to yesterday afternoon at Lou's loft,
and Sarah. Her hallucinations still haunted me. What had happened to her in the
rain forest? And why would she say she wanted to go back?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I snapped back. &quot;All right. Try and ring him if you
think he can help. Right now I need all I can get.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He got up and worked his way to the phone, past the crowded
bar, while I tried to contemplate the night sky. I looked up again, hoping to
see Orion, but now a dark cloud had moved in, leaving nothing but deepening
blackness. He'd said there was a storm brewing, part of an out-of-season
hurricane developing in the Caribbean, so I guessed this was the first
harbinger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tonight's out, but tomorrow's okay.&quot; He was
striding back. &quot;Crack of dawn. Which for him is roughly about noon. We'll
have a quick get-together and then I've got to run. Re­ally. But if this guy
doesn't know what's going on down here, nobody does. He's probably laid half
those hot tomatillos there at the bar. The man has his sources, if you get my
meaning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then let's go back to the glorious Camino Real.&quot; I
took his hand. &quot;We'll split the check. At the moment, even that seems
romantic.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm still thinking about—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't. Don't think.&quot; I touched his lips, soft and
moist, then kissed him. An impulsive but deeply felt act. &quot;We've all had
enough thinking for one day.&quot;</span></p>

<h2><a name=bookmark19>Chapter Seventeen</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='color:windowtext'>A</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>lan Dupre didn't ring till almost
ten-thirty the next morn­ing, and I had the feeling even that was a stretch. He
then offered to meet us in the Parque Concordia, right downtown. As I watched
him ambling toward our bench, my first im­pression was: Why'd we bother?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The man appeared to be in his early forties, puffy-eyed and
pink-cheeked with discount aviator shades, looking like a glad-handing tourist
just down to Central America for a weekend of unchaperoned bacchanals. The flowered
sport shirt, worn outside the belt, gave him the aura of a tout in­sufficiently
attired without a can of Coors in hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How can this be progress? I'm down here hoping to find Sarah,
and I end up in a trash-filled park meeting some expat operator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Steve had explained that the main benefit of Alan Dupre's CIA
gig was that he did learn how to fly a helicopter. With that skill he'd ended
up starting a tourist agency in Guatemala City using an old Bell he leased:
&quot;Mayan Pyramids from the Air.&quot; Mainly, though, he was a self-styled
bon vivant who knew people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Steve the brave.&quot; On came Dupre's mirthless smile
as he approached a jaunty spring entering his step.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alan, any friend of yours has got to be brave.&quot;
Steve just stared at him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dupre had the kind of empty grin that looked like it'd been
rehearsed in his high school bathroom mirror. It was thin, kind of forked and
dangerous, and this morning its plas­ter quality undermined any attempts at
honesty. Maybe deal­ing with complaining tourists every day of your life did
that to you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You called, I came.&quot; He was now shifting from foot
to foot. &quot;Guess it finally had to happen. What's the phrase? You can run
but you can't hide? Surprise us both and pretend you're happy to see me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Steve looked like he was not entirely prepared for this
moment. He used the awkward pause that followed to intro­duce me. Dupre shook
hands like he was fearful of germs, then turned back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jesus, man, I'm still working on the money, honest to
God. But do I get a last cigarette before the firing squad?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, Alan, ease up.&quot; Steve was deadpan. &quot;Good
to see you again. I mean it. Love that Waikiki shirt, by the way. Never knew
you had such progressive taste.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is actually my incognito attire. For secret
missions. It's my objective today to look like some cruise-ship jerk.&quot; He
glanced around nervously. &quot;So how'm I doing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd say your years of training in undercover work have
paid off.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I listened, remembering Steve had explained that Alan Dupre's
career as a CIA information-gatherer was hampered by his propensity to drink
too much tequila and then brag about his occupation, hoping to impress whatever
woman he had in his sights at the moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So bring me up to date.&quot; Steve was trying to hide
his total contempt. &quot;Why'd you get out of the spook business? Langley
couldn't find a 'new mission' for you after the Evil Empire dissolved?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dupre's face turned pensive. &quot;Man, you don't get it, do
you? Langley's still got plenty on its mind. Nothing has changed. Most people
don't realize the U.S. isn't run by the folks they vote for. There's a
permanent government that doesn't appear on Larry King, and I was part of it.
The Cen­tral Intelligence Agency of the U.S. of A. will go on doing exactly
what it's always done, guiding events in Third World toilets like this through
whatever means are necessary to pro­tect America's strategic concerns. Keeping
the world safe for Microsoft and Ronald McDonald.&quot; He paused and glanced
at me, as though slightly embarrassed. Then he continued. &quot;What I'm saying
is, all those Beltway turkeys with the briar pipes and gigabyte computers,
sitting around wringing their hands, worried the Company needs a new mission,
never really grasped its old mission.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're right,&quot; Steve said going along with the
shtick, the applause lines Dupre had doubtless used in a thousand bars.
&quot;I'm getting slow. What Langley needs nowadays is a new cover story.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Couldn't have phrased it better.&quot; Dupre smiled
again too easily. &quot;They're—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Actually,&quot; Steve said cutting him off impatiently,
all the while gazing up at the gathering dark clouds as though they were a
hovering adversary, &quot;the truth of the matter is, we called you to discuss
a favor. A small helping hand.&quot; He seemed to be searching for a sales
point. &quot;For old times' sake.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;For old times' sake?&quot; Dupre appeared to be having
trouble with the concept.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah. All we want is to hear a little talk of the
town.&quot; He gazed out over the square, Uzi-toting police still strolling by.
&quot;You know, local information of the kind that doesn't make the papers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right,&quot; I said. &quot;For starters, how could a
gringa sort of melt into the Peten rain forest, disappear for months and
months, and then end up in a coma?&quot; I'd decided to feel him out before
going for the bigger questions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;People disappear down here all the time, and nobody in
their right mind goes around inquiring why.&quot; Dupre seemed genuinely
astonished that anyone would find such a thing unusual. He also was fingering a
cigarette pack in his breast pocket, clearly nervous about the quick turn our conversation
had taken. &quot;Whatever's your problem in Guatemala, just for­get about it.
Drink some <i>cerveza</i>, take a few snapshots of the picturesque natives, and
then move on to a civilized place. This is a land of mystery, lady, and the
people who matter like it that way. There are those here who take their privacy
very seriously.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just like Alex Goddard's Children of Light, I thought. Or
Ninos del Mundo, or whatever it's called. It was chilling to hear Alan Dupre
backing away so quickly from my question. The guy seemed truly scared under all
the bluster. I also observed that his eyes were curiously small, out of propor­tion
to his face. I hadn't noticed it at first.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well,&quot; I went on, determined to push him, &quot;an
old land­ing card for the person I'm looking for said her destination was a
place called Ninos del Mundo, up in the Peten. I as­sume that's somewhere in
the northern rain forest, right? So I guess what I want to know is, does that
name stir up any connections?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked around, then extracted a Gauloise from a blue pack
and lit it with a wooden match, flicking the tip with his fingernail. He
inhaled, taking his time. &quot;Well, maybe I've heard a little something about
a place some people call by that name.&quot; He drew again on the cigarette.
&quot;And the story might include a female American <i>tourista</i> or
two—about one a year, actually—who've sort of melted into the forest never to
be seen more. I'm not exactly sure where it is, though. Or even if what you
hear is true. But who cares? Come on, guys, this is Guatemala, for chrissake.
Shit happens. Get a life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The embassy, or the CIA, or anybody ever carry out an
inquiry?&quot; I felt my energy rising. &quot;A woman every year or so? I went
by Reforma Avenue yesterday and nobody there seems to have ever heard of any of
this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No kidding.&quot; He snorted. &quot;Whatever happened
that place, our caring embassy, ain't gonna do zip—don't faint at the news—and
there's no way the Company's going to pull their old-time Yankee number, roll
in with the beige sunglasses, and yell, 'Okay, you peons, we're here to take
names and kick butt. What happened to our national?' They've recently acquired
a habit of taking local situations at face value. Makes for a lot better tables
at the tony supper clubs in town.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This guy liked to talk, I realized but he had no interest in
going beyond glib one-liners. I glanced at Steve, and I could tell he was
having the same thoughts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell you what,&quot; Steve said finally, &quot;how
about this? Tell us whatever you know about how to find this place, and maybe
we can adjust the terms on the money you screwed me out of. I might settle for
something less on the dollar and let bygones be bygones.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, man, you'll get your money. I'm good for it.&quot;
Dupre sighed and drew on his Gauloise. &quot;It's just that things are a little
tight right now, you know.&quot; He paused. &quot;Matter of fact, I was hoping
you might be able to spare a couple of bills for a week or so. But I guess . .
.&quot; His voice trailed off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alan Dupre knew something I needed to know, or might know it.
Steve had definitely found the right guy in that regard. But he clearly was
cautious to the point of paralysis as he kept furtively glancing around. What
was he so fearful of, and what could I do to convince him to help me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I stood gazing at the dark sky for a long moment, and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>then I had an
off-the-wall idea, a long shot, the all-or-nothing take you go for when the sun
is dying and the unions are looking at overtime.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You do tourist flights, right?&quot; I started, still
working on the idea. &quot;So how about pretending I'm an eco nut? A lover of the
rain forest. You can tell whoever you're so afraid of that you're taking me up
into the wilds to show me jaguars or something. A regular tour. Just cruising
around, taking in the sights. Totally innocent. And then if we accidentally
scouted a little, maybe we could find the place.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jesus, you're serious about this, aren't you?&quot;
Dupre nervously crushed out his cigarette, staring at me glassy-eyed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Never been more.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He extracted another Gauloise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, a counteroffer, Miss . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;James. Morgan James.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right, Miss James. I'm beginning to think you've got no
realistic sense of proportion about this part of the world. You—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Fools rush in, right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My point precisely. But if Steve here means what he
says, well, maybe there's a little room to negotiate. Maybe I could take you on
a quick sightseeing trip. And just for laughs I could kind of inadvertently
stray over the area I think you might find productive. Assuming we can locate
it. But here're my terms. I do it and Steverino and me are square. Consider it
a twenty-thousand-dollar cruise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Fine with me.&quot; Steve didn't even blink, and I
loved him all over again, right on the spot. Though the truth was, I knew he'd
never planned on seeing a penny of the money again anyway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And you think this place is Ninos del Mundo?&quot; I
was trying not to get my hopes up too much, but still . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dupre lit his new cigarette. &quot;You didn't hear this from
me, okay? You heard it from the embassy or some other damned place. But that's
one name for it. Another is 'Jungle Disneyland.' Actually, I think the local
name is <i>Baalum</i>, the old Maya word for jaguar. But everybody acts like
it's a state secret, so all you get are rumors.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, assuming we find it, then how could I get in? I
mean actually in.&quot; I was squinting at him, feeling my body tense. What was
it Lou had said about a word he'd heard when they were taking Sarah? It sounded
like &quot;Babylon&quot;? I also thought that was what she'd whispered to me.
Could it be the word was actually Baalum? The gloomy morning skies abruptly
flooded with the brilliant white light of hope. I glanced back at Steve, and
our eyes locked for a long mo­ment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgy, for chrissake, what are you saying?&quot; Steve
took my hand. &quot;Don't you realize this is Guatemala? Don't even think about
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We're just talking now, okay?&quot; I squeezed his hand
then looked back at Dupre. &quot;I was just wondering. Once we've found it,
could I get a sneak look-see? Assuming I wanted to?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I'll tell you one thing, Miss Morgan James.&quot;
Dupre was fingering his new cigarette, oblivious to my reaction. &quot;Give no
serious thought to just driving up. The Army'd be all over your butt in the
time it takes to cock an AK-47.&quot; He glanced up at the sky again, though
now a dense bank of dark clouds had swallowed what remained of the sun. A
pre-rain gloom was enveloping the park, which was starting to empty out, the
hawkers and loiterers headed home to wait out the weather. &quot;But if we do
find it, then as long as we're there, I might be able to drop you off for a
quick glance somehow, say, if we did it around twilight time . . . that is, if
that's what you want. But it's ten minutes tops, and that's my final offer.
Frankly, I think you'd be ill-advised in the extreme to do it, but . . . in any
case, it's got to be a low-profile enterprise all the way. We screw this up and
we could easily swell the ranks of the 'disappeared.' &quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But you think you could actually locate it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What I hear, the place is on a tributary of the
Usumacinta River, a latrine they call the Rio Tigre. Way up in the north­west.
Low-level Army types, you meet them in bars from time to time, like to BS about
it. I've got a rough idea where it might be, though you don't know whether to
believe a bunch of kid recruits after half-a-dozen beers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then my mind clicked. The Rio Tigre? Didn't that have
something to do with where Lou said Sarah was found? That was definitely where
I wanted to go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgy, have you lost your senses?&quot; Steve had
placed his hand on my shoulder. &quot;If the Army's involved in something down
here, you don't want to know about it. Don't lose sight of the fact those goons
knocked off two hundred thousand villagers since the freedom-loving days of the
Gipper, for fear they might be Commies, with the CIA practically flying in the
ammo. This whole damned country's just one big mass grave. Yet another
unclaimed corpse or two won't make a hell of a lot of difference.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Steve, I'll bet you anything that's where she is.&quot;
Saying it, I had a vision of all the things that had happened to me, and to
Sarah, because of Alex Goddard. I couldn't wait to confront the bastard.
&quot;He's brought her back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Steve just glared at me for a long moment, despairing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Christ, you make me nuts. Okay, look, how about this?
At least let me come with you. That way we'll face the un­known together.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Though I had a lump-in-the-throat moment, I didn't say
anything, just stood there glorying in the feeling of being together. It was so
wonderful to have him with me and so difficult to think about pressing on
without him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was a long, awkward pause, and then he glanced at his
watch. &quot;Blast, I've got to hit the road if I'm going to get back in time
to set up for tonight's shoot. I just pray I can beat the rain.&quot; Then he
pulled me around and circled me fully in his arms.          &quot;Please,
Morgy, I really don't like the sound of this. I'll move heaven and earth to get
back here by Friday night, and if you still want to check out this '<i>Baalum' </i>place,
then we'll figure out a way to do it together.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just you stay safe.&quot; I hugged him back.
&quot;Nothing I do is going to mean much if I don't have you. Don't worry. I'll
be okay.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alan Dupre had abruptly taken an even deeper interest in the
darkening sky. I got the feeling he was uncomfortable being around two people
capable of caring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's only for a couple of days,&quot; Steve went on.
&quot;We'll both be okay if we just stick together.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right,&quot; I said, and kissed him harder than I ever
had.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Five minutes later, my heart and my head still at war with
each other, I was alone in the virtually empty park with my brand-new best
friend. Watching Steve's Jeep blend into the smoggy haze of the avenue made me
feel like half of me had just disappeared into another dimension.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So that's that,&quot; I declared finally, turning back
and taking a deep breath. I had to find Sarah before something else truly horrible
happened to her. And the one thing I was de­termined to do was keep Steve as
safely distant from my search as I could, even though it meant I was going to
be terribly lonely for the next few days. &quot;When can we leave?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, get real.&quot; Dupre choked, whirling around.
&quot;We can't go today. Case you hadn't noticed, there's a storm coming. If
you really want to go . . . and I mean really want to, then maybe in a day or
so. Preferably when Steve—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't want to drag him into this,&quot; I said
evenly. Truth­fully, I was sounding braver than I felt. But then I remem­bered
once going down into the four-hundred-year-old sub­terranean harem quarters of
the Red Fort in Agra, seemingly miles underground and pitch black, with nothing
but a flash­light, surrounded by screaming bats and knee-deep in guano, for no
better reason than I was determined to see how the women there once lived. So
how much scarier could this be?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I say no way,&quot; Dupre told me. &quot;Not
today. Correc­tion, make that no fucking way.&quot; He had removed his aviator
shades and was cleaning them with a dirty hanky. &quot;Besides, I don't think
you have any business going up there in the first place. If you're not scared
shitless, you ought to be.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alan, I think you 're the one who's afraid to go.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He almost reached for another cigarette, but then stopped
himself. &quot;I will definitely plead guilty to a deep-seated dis­quiet about
the people who rule this placid paradise. But if it'll square things with
Steve, then I'll take you up to have a quick look, for my sins. But it's got to
be after the weather clears.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I finally realized he was already thinking about his next
loan. Steve, beware.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tomorrow then?&quot; I wasn't going to blink, because
the Peten was where Sarah had ended up the first time and I was sure that was
where Ramos had taken her now. <i>Baalum</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Dupre stared at the sky a moment longer, then caved.
&quot;Maybe we can shoot for tomorrow late. If I can convince myself this storm
has done its worst.&quot; He looked back at me. &quot;But I gotta tell you one
thing, Ms. Morgan James. We blun­der in up there and end up getting ourselves
'disappeared,' we won't even get our pictures in the papers. You'd better tell
your immediate loved ones where you're going, and it wouldn't be the worst time
in the world to think about making a will.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The way he said it, I was sure for once he meant every word.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='color:windowtext'>W</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>hen I got back to the Camino Real,
the time was early afternoon and the bed was freshly made, with all signs and
scents of my and Steve's torrid reunion long gone. I tried to push aside
thoughts of how much I was already missing him and focus on what I was getting
myself into. I must admit I was having serious qualms about going up to the
Peten, the part of Guatemala where Sarah had been left for dead, with my
brand-new tour director, the flaky Alan Dupre. I'd never been in a helicopter
before, much less one flying over a stormy rain forest. On the other hand, if
that was where they'd taken Sarah, the sooner I got there, the better.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sitting there in the room, I found myself feeling right at
home: Everything about it was so familiar to an expert on budget travel like
me. Off-brand carpet the color of decaying vegetation, the usual two double
beds (one totally unused, except as a suitcase shelf), the TV suspended over
the dresser and bolted to the wall. Funny, but it was the first time I'd
noticed half the things in the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay, I told myself, the thing to do first is call St.
Vincent's and check on Lou. Also, I wanted to tell him what was hap­pening. I
just hoped he wouldn't launch into a lecture about the recklessness of what I
was planning. I needed support, not male advice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I got the desk to give me the local AT&amp;T contact number,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>then rang
right through to St. Vincent's. The next thing I knew, they were calling his
room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi. How's the patient?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgan, what the hell are you up to? I've been trying
to reach you. I finally called David and he said you'd left a mes­sage;
something about Central America. Why the hell—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was trying to explain that to you Sunday night, but
you were pretty far gone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I ain't that far gone now, so I'm telling you
to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;By the way,&quot; I interrupted, hoping to change the
subject, &quot;how're you feeling?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I guess I'll live. They let me get up and go to the
bath­room now. They're saying I can probably go home tomor­row.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's encouraging.&quot; Thank God he was going to be
okay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I also had a talk with Gerry, downtown. He believes
Sarah was kidnapped, even if New York's Finest don't, so that means the FBI has
jurisdiction. We're gonna get some action. They're trying to get a photo of
that colonel, so maybe I can ID the bastard. But the consulate's giving us a
lot of shit about it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I'm tracking something down here. Between the two
of us, I think we'll find her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So, what the hell are you doing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I told him about finding the name of a destination on Sarah's
old landing card, and about meeting a guy who was going to take me there as
soon as the weather cleared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And you think she could be there now?&quot; He didn't
sound hopeful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There're reasons to check it out.&quot; I didn't want
to elabo­rate. &quot;Maybe we'll get lucky.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was attempting to say as little as possible, fearing the
phone was tapped. In that spirit, I decided to get off the line as quickly as
possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Lou, you get lots of rest, and I'll try and
call you tomor­row.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With a final warning to watch out for myself, he took down my
hotel number and hung up. Truthfully, he was sounding pretty tired and weak,
not nearly his old self.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, he had a right to be. But at least there were no
complications.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My next call was going to be to David Roth, to check in on
things at Applecore, but first I wanted to order up some<i> huevos rancheros</i>,
get some breakfast protein. I was becom­ing energized by the prospect of
progress, and being that way always makes me ravenous. It's probably a primal
female response that has a Latin name.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I checked out the number for room service, and was lit­erally
reaching for the black phone when it rang of its own accord. Startled I picked
up the receiver, wondering who had my number.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hello.&quot; It was a man's voice that sounded vaguely
fa­miliar. &quot;Thought I'd check in and see how things are going with your
search.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi,&quot; I answered back after a pause, trying to
place his intonation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, sorry. Barry Morton. Remember me? Fortress Amer­ica.
You came by the office yesterday.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How . . . ?&quot; Why was he calling me? &quot;How did
you get this—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You must have accidentally put the wrong hotel on your
landing card as your address in Guatemala City.&quot; He hesi­tated a second
then said &quot;But I had my secretary call around and . . . well, it happens
all the time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I see.&quot; It did have the ring of logic. And I had
put down a different hotel. A safety measure. &quot;Do you always take this
much . . . interest in your fellow citizens?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Only when they come to see me personally.&quot; He
chuck­led. &quot;So how's it going?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, thanks for calling,&quot; I said.
&quot;Everything's moving along.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good, good.&quot; There was another pause, then,
&quot;Inciden­tally, you having any luck finding that Ninos del Mundo place you
were looking for?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I hesitated, wondering why he would ask and also unsure what
to say.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not yet,&quot; I volunteered. My God, it finally dawned
on me. The guy was tracking me. He wanted to know what I knew. &quot;You come
up with anything at your end?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've been busy, a string of meetings, but I still think
you might want to check out the phone book.&quot; It was the second time he'd
made the suggestion. He was practically ordering me to do it. Why? &quot;You
never know. I'm afraid that's about the best I can do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe I will,&quot; I said. &quot;I've been a little
busy too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The phone call was feeling stranger and stranger. He was
sending me to see something, probably in hopes it would make me go away. It was
actually more unnerving than if he'd done nothing at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, in any case, I hope you have a good visit,&quot;
he declared diplomatically. Another pause. &quot;Planning to be here
long?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not sure yet.&quot; Why did he want to know that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I see. Whatever happens, I hope you find what you're
looking for. Best of luck.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He hung up, leaving me with the feeling he already knew the
answer to every question he'd asked. The guys at the airport, and now the
embassy—I was the best-known tourist in the country.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay, maybe I should just play along and see what hap­pens.
In any case, I'd just lost my appetite for fried eggs with hot sauce, but I had
a definite interest in the phone book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And there they were. Ninos del Mundo. Complete with an
address, way out the Boulevar R. Aguilar Batres.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, why not see where it leads you? Sarah's card said the
place was in the Peten, but who knows?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I got up off the bed and went into the bathroom for a shampoo
and shower. Despite the fact that Barry Morton wanted me to see this Ninos del
Mundo place, whatever it was, I didn't want to show up looking and smelling
like some bedraggled tourist. I'd wear my tailored blue suit, which, along with
the dark blue heels, ought to make me look ade­quately businesslike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The shower was wonderful, purging away the soot of the park,
and I was wrapping my hair in a large beige towel when the phone jangled again.
I tucked in the edge to secure it and walked over. Maybe it was Lou ringing
back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No such luck. The caller was none other than my brand-new
partner Alan Dupre. I was not thrilled to hear his voice. Was he about to get cold
feet and back out?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgan, listen,&quot; he said, not wasting time on
niceties, &quot;there's been a small change of plans. I've—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alan, don't do this to me.&quot; You shit. &quot;You
agreed— &quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, why I'm calling is, we've got to go ahead and go up
today, storm or no, God help us. You happy now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What? After that neurotic song-and-dance he'd just given me
in the park? I should have been overjoyed, but something about the whole thing
immediately felt synthetic. I paused a long moment, trying to think the
situation through. What was going on?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The answer to that was clear as day. I was being set up.
Somebody wanted me out of town, and they'd just found a way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Or was I being paranoid again? Had the weather cleared? I
reached over and pushed aside a curtain. Nope, it looked as threatening as
ever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No question. This was definitely a setup.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On the other hand why not use whoever had put him up to this?
This told me for sure I was on the trail of Sarah, and the sooner I got going,
the better. Aside from calling New York and then checking out the local Ninos
del Mundo that Barry Morton wanted me to see so badly, I had no other pressing
plans. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alan, I thought you declared no 'effing' way were you
going to go today,&quot; I said testing him. &quot;Why the sudden revision in
scheduling?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah, well, something heavy's come up for tomorrow. I'm
afraid it's gotta be now or forget it for at least a week.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Unrefined bullshit. But somebody knew how badly I wanted to
go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, there's something I need to check out first. I
just learned about a place here in town I want to at least see. It's also
called Ninos del Mundo.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No shit.&quot; He paused. &quot;Okay, we'll talk about
it. Get the address and maybe we can cruise by if there's time. Thing is, we
don't have all that much leeway here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;One last question.&quot; I thought I'd give him a final
shot at the truth. &quot;Just tell me honestly why it has to be today. The real
story.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Like I said everything's changed.&quot; He wasn't
budging. &quot;So if we're doing this, I've got to pick you up now and get us
on our merry way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was too cheerful by half, which definitely told me he was
lying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right, but I really need to make at least one phone
call first.&quot; I wanted Steve to know where I was. &quot;And if I walk out
of here with a bag, I've got to let the desk know I'm not skipping on the
bill.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Forget the phone call. No time. Do it after we get
back. Just be out front in exactly nineteen minutes. This is not a dry run. The
train is leaving. I'm outta here now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was a click and he was gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I sat there a moment staring at the floor. What was I getting
into?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, there's one way to find out. Play their game and beat
them. There's no better way to get inside what's going on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The first thing I did was call Steve's hotel in Belize City.
Of course he wasn't there, but I left a long message to the effect that I was
taking a &quot;sightseeing&quot; trip up to the Peten with Alan Dupre today
because of unforeseen new circum­stances. The reasons were complicated, but I'd
watch out for myself and therefore he shouldn't worry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That out of the way, I looked around the room. It was a
disaster, but I quickly began cramming things into the small folding backpack I
always took on trips. Then I rang the kitchen and told them to make up a
quadruple egg sandwich (<i>quatro huevos, por favor</i>) to go, along with a
large bottle of distilled water.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By the time I got to the reception desk and explained I
wasn't actually checking out for good, Alan Dupre was al­ready waiting outside
in his battered green Jeep, cleaning his scratchy shades and leaning on the horn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Let him wait. I wrote out a long note to Steve, on the chance
he might come looking for me. Then with deliberate slowness, I wandered out to
where Alan's Jeep was parked and tossed my backpack behind the seat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;First things first.&quot; I climbed in and handed him
the ad­dress of Ninos del Mundo I'd copied onto some hotel sta­tionery.
&quot;This is where we've got to go.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stared at it a moment, puzzling, and then seemed to figure
out where it was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Upscale part of this beautiful oasis.&quot; He shifted
into gear. &quot;But it's more or less on the way.&quot; He glanced up
nervously at the sky. &quot;We just don't have all day.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Off we headed toward the suburbs, through a ganglia of
downtown streets laced with pizza joints and frying-meat vendors, till we
eventually ended up on a tree-lined avenue that looked as genteel as Oyster
Bay. When we got to the address, I told him to park across the way, and just
sat a moment staring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The building itself was a windowless compound sur­rounded by
trees and a high wall of white stucco, with a guardhouse and wide iron gate
(not unusual for Guatemala) protecting a long walkway. The whole thing looked
like a fortress, except the view through the gate was a pastoral vista of neat
flower beds and a pristine lawn. The guardhouse itself had a dozing teenager,
undoubtedly with an Uzi resting across his lap.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, Alan,&quot; I said &quot;time to get with the
program. How's your Spanish?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Depends on who I'm trying to BS.&quot; He shrugged and
began cleaning his sunglasses again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, why don't you see if you can talk us past that
guard.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stared at the entrance a moment. &quot;Be a waste of our
precious time. Tell you right now, kids like that only answer to one boss, the <i>jefe</i>,
the big guy, whoever he is. That's how they retain their employment. A joint
locked down this tight don't give Sunday tours.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I think he's asleep. So I'm going to be creative
and see if there's a back entrance of some kind. Maybe a service area that'll
give me some idea of what's going on here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do what you want, but make it fast,&quot; he said,
leaning back in the seat. &quot;And try not to get shot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I carefully got out and walked down the empty street a way,
then followed the stucco wall/fence—the building cov­ered an entire city
block—until I came across an alley en­trance, with another large iron gate,
padlocked shut.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I peered up the driveway, shrouded in overhanging trees, but
there was nothing in the parking lot except a couple of Army Jeeps. And a black
Land Rover.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, Barry Morton really wanted me to see this. But why? Is
there a connection to the place in the Peten? And what are the Army vehicles
all about?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I sighed and made my way back to the street. When I reached
the Jeep, Alan was gone, but then I realized he was over talking to the young
guard, offering him a cigarette. A few moments later he waved good-bye and
casually ambled back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay.&quot; He settled in and hit the ignition.
&quot;Here's the official deal. This place is some kind of hospice for unwed
mothers. They also take in orphans, or so he thinks. Accord­ing to him, no
American women have ever had anything to do with the place, which is probably
why I'd never heard of it.&quot; He glanced at me as we sped off. &quot;You
happy now? Debriefing young Army dudes is a specialty of mine, so I think
that's probably the straight scoop.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did you ask if it's connected with something in the Pe­ten?&quot;
I was still hoping. In any case, whatever it was, I was collecting more pieces
of the puzzle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, give me a break.&quot; He shifted up, gaining
speed. &quot;I know when to push, and this wasn't the precise moment. The kid
was itchy enough as it was. Like, who the fuck are you, gringo, and what are
you doing here? I got all I could get without a cold <i>cerveza</i>.&quot; He
glanced over. &quot;You ask me, a little gratitude wouldn't be entirely out of
place.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay. <i>Muchas gracias, amigo</i>. Happy now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Ecstatic.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Jeep was open and I checked out the sky, which was
growing darker and more threatening by the minute. The promised foul weather
still seemed to be just that, promised but it was definitely on the way. Alan
Dupre must really be scared. Finally I leaned back in the torn plastic seat and
closed my eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was this Ninos del Mundo the Latin branch of Children of
Light? The place where Alex Goddard's babies came from? Considering the
interest Colonel Ramos had in my movie, the Army Jeeps could be a tip-off.
Also, there seemed to be an even chance that Barry Morton was involved some­how.
But it was all still guesswork. And anyway, this wasn't the place Sarah had put
on her landing card. <i>That </i>Ninos del Mundo was somewhere up north, hidden
in the rain forest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

color:windowtext'>&quot;</span><b><span style='color:windowtext'>W</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>hat did he say?&quot; I asked, not
quite catching the burst of rapid-fire Spanish from the cockpit. The explosion
of ex­pletives had included the word <i>navegacion</i>. Something about
malfunction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>God help us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alan Dupre's helicopter reminded me of the disintegrating
taxis on Guatemala City's potholed streets. The vibration in the passenger
compartment was so violent it made my teeth chatter. My stomach felt like it
was in a cocktail shaker, and the deafening roar could have been the voice of
Hell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was staring out the smudgy plastic window, where less than
three hundred meters below I could just make out the top of the Peten rain
forest of northwest Guatemala sweeping by beneath us. So this was what it
looked like. Dense and impenetrable, it was a yawning, deciduous carpet
enveloping the earth as far as the eye could see—if something ten stories high
could be called carpet. I'd been in the forests of India's Kerala and seen some
of the denser growth in southern Mex­ico, but this was like another planet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The main problem was, a violent downpour, the leading edge of
the hurricane, was now sweeping across the Yucatan, stirring up the treetops of
the jungles below. The rain, which had begun in earnest about ten minutes after
we got airborne, had been steadily increasing to the point it was now almost
blinding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This was the risk I'd chosen to take, but let me admit right
here: The weather had me seriously scared, my fingernails digging into the
armrests and my pulse erratic. And now was there something else? We'd only been
in the air for thirty-five minutes, and already we had some kind of mechanical
issue looming? What was left to go wrong?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Some of the lights went out or something.&quot; Dupre
tried a shrug. &quot;I'm not sure. No big deal, though. This old bird always
gets the job done.&quot; His pilot, Lieutenant Villatoro, formerly of the
Guatemalan Army, had just shouted the new development back to the cabin.
&quot;Probably nothing. Don't worry about it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Don't worry about it! His &quot;tourist&quot; helicopter was
a Guatemalan candidate for the Air &amp; Space Museum, an old Bell UH-1D
patched together with chicle and corn masa. Surely the storm was pushing it far
beyond its stress limits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right, but what exactly—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sounds like the nav station.&quot; He clicked open his
seat belt. &quot;Something . . . Who knows? If you'd be happier, I'll go up and
look.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I felt my palms go cold. &quot;Doesn't seem too much to ask,
considering.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The world down below us was a hostile mélange of tow­ering
trees, all straining for the sky, while the ground itself was a dark tangle of
ferns, lianas, strangler vines, creepers—among which lurked Olympic scorpions
and some of the Earth's most poisonous snakes. If we had to set down here—I
didn't even want to think about it. To lower a helicopter into the waves of
flickering green below us would be to confront the hereafter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's just the lights, like he said.&quot; Dupre yelled
back from the cockpit's door, letting a tone of &quot;I told you to chill
out&quot; seep through. He was peering past the opening, at the long line of
instruments. He followed his announcement with a sigh as he moved back into the
main cabin. &quot;Relax.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I wasn't relaxed and from the way his eyes were shifting and
his Gauloise cigarettes were being chain-smoked he was on the verge of a
nervous breakdown. In his case it wasn't just the weather. He was fidgeting
like a trapped animal, giving me the distinct sense he was doing someone's
invisible bidding and was terrified he might fail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, why don't you try and fix it?&quot; Was he trying
to act calm just to impress me? &quot;Can't you bang on the panel or
something?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, okay, let me see what I can do. Jesus!&quot; He
edged back into the cockpit, next to Villatoro. The wind was shak­ing us so
badly that, even bent over, he was having trouble keeping his balance. Then he
halfheartedly slammed the dark instrument readouts with the heel of his open
hand. When the effort produced no immediate electronic miracle, he set­tled
into the copilot's seat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Que pasa</i>? &quot; he yelled at Villatoro, his
voice barely audi­ble over the roar of the engine and the plastering of rain on
the fuselage. Then he looked out the windscreen, at the tor­rent slamming
against it, and rubbed at his chin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>No se, mi comandante</i>,&quot; the Guatemalan
shouted back. I sensed he was hoping to sound efficient and unperturbed. Dupre
claimed his pilot had personally checked out the Bell and prepped it. Now,
though . . . &quot;<i>Mira</i>. Like I said the lights. On the nav station.
Maybe the electrical—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How about the backup battery?&quot; Dupre was just
barely keeping his cool.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Villatoro scratched his chin. &quot;I'll tell you the truth.
The backup is <i>muerto</i>. I tested it before we left, but I couldn't find
any replacements in Provisiones. I figure, no problem, but now, amigo . .
.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I felt another wave of dismay, right into my churning stom­ach.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, keep your heading north.&quot; Dupre's voice was
com­ing from a place of extreme pain. &quot;And if you sight the Rio Tigre,
then <i>Baalum</i> or whatever should be more or less due west, according to
what I'm assuming. Just keep your eyes open.&quot; He paused. &quot;Problem is,
with all this rain, the river's going to be tough to make out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I redoubled my efforts to peer out the window, searching, my
breath coming in bursts. Still nothing. Dear God, what now?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally Dupre headed back, bracing himself against the
firewall as he crouched and passed through the door into the main cabin. When
he settled into the seat across from me, he was glaring at me as though
everything was my fault. &quot;You know.&quot; He was yelling again. &quot;I'm
beginning to think maybe we ought to try to find a clearing and just sit out
this crap till morning.&quot; He leaned over and peered down through the Bell's
spattered side windows at the dense tangle of growth below. After a moment he
got up and once more moved the toward the cockpit, still with the same troubled
look. This time, how­ever, he was beaming as he shouted back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There may be a God after all. I think we just
intersected the Rio Tigre. We can bear due west now, along the river. We could
be getting close, if it's where I think it is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I turned and stared down again, barely making out the thread
of the stream through the rain. Yes! Maybe there's hope. Still, below us the
windblown treetops were a solid mass of pastel sparkles, a dancing sea of
hungry green . . . But then I thought I saw something. Hey! It might even be a
clearing. I quickly unbuckled and made my way up to the cockpit, hanging on to
anything I could grasp.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alan, look,&quot; I yelled, and pointed off to the side,
out</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>through the
rain-obscured windscreen. &quot;I think we just passed over something. Back
there. See?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where?&quot; He squinted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You can still just make it out.&quot; I twisted and
kept pointing. I was biting my lip, trying to hold together. &quot;There . . .
it looks like some kind of clearing. Maybe . . . I don't know, but what if we
just set down there and let this storm blow over?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He ordered Villatoro to bank and go back for a look. A few
moments later it was obvious there was an opening in the trees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah, let's check it out.&quot; He then said something
to Vil­latoro and we started easing toward it, definitely a wide open­ing. The
billowing ocean of trees below us seemed to be parting like the Red Sea as we
settled in. There had to be solid ground down there somewhere. Had to be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's . . .&quot; I was pointing. &quot;There, over to
the side, it's a kind of hill or something. It's—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where?&quot; Dupre squinted again, his voice starting
to crack. Then he focused in. &quot;Yeah, maybe there's something there. Hard
to tell what it is, though. But I guess we're about to find out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He gestured to the lieutenant, barking an order in quick
Spanish. While the Bell kept moving lower through the open­ing, Dupre flicked
on the landing lights, and appeared to be muttering a prayer of thanks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was staring out, growing ever more puzzled. A
&quot;hill&quot; was there, all right. The problem was, it was definitely
man-made, topped by a stone building. I could just make it out in the glare of
the lights.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you think that is?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do I think?&quot; Dupre studied the scene for a
moment longer, and then his face melted into the first smile I'd seen since we
left. &quot;I think we are lucky beyond belief. God help us, we may have found
it. That could be the damned pyramid or whatever's supposed to be up here.&quot;
He leaned back. &quot;Yeah, congratulations. Look at that damned thing. Either
this is the place, or we're about to become the archaeologists of the year.
Cover of <i>Time</i>. The Nobel frigging Prize.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment I almost wanted to hug Alan Dupre, but not
quite. Instead I moved farther into the cockpit, trying to get a look out the
windscreen. By then we had lowered well through the opening in the trees, the
helicopter's controls fighting against the blowing rain, and it felt as though
we'd begun descending into the ocean's depths in a diving bell, surrounded by
thrashing, wind-whipped branches.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now, though, I was staring at the ghostly rise of the pyra­mid
emerging out of the rain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It looks brand new.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah, the whole place is 'Jungle Disneyland' remember?
Except this deal ain't about Mickey Mouse, believe me. There's plenty of Army
hanging out around here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Lieutenant Villatoro took us ever lower, gently guiding the
chopper's descent, and now we were only a few feet above the ground. There
certainly was no mistaking what was around us, even with the blowing rain. The
pyramid loomed over one side of a large plaza, a big paved area that was mostly
obscured from the skies since the swaying trees arched over and covered it from
aerial view.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, we're about to touch down.&quot; Dupre was
clawing at his pocket, yearning for a cigarette. &quot;So if you still want to
get out, move over by the door. I'll disengage the main rotor once we're on the
ground.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As we settled in, the rotor began to cause surface effect,
throwing a spray off the paving stones, which now glistened under the cold beam
of the landing lights. And looming above us, off to the right, was a stepped
pyramid in the classic Mayan style. We all lapsed into silence as the Bell's
skids thumped onto the stones. The ex-Army pilot, Villatoro, kept glancing over
at the pyramid as though he didn't want to admit even seeing it. Did he know
something Alan and I didn't?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This was the moment I'd been bracing for. I was increas­ingly
convinced somebody wanted me to see this place, whatever it was, but now what
should I do?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, the first thing was to dip my toe in the water, do a
quick reconnoiter on the ground. If this really was <i>Baalum</i>, Dupre's Maya
Disneyland, could it also be part of Alex Goddard's clinic of
&quot;miracles,&quot; the location Sarah called Ninos del Mundo? If I knew that
for sure, then I could start figuring how to find out if she was here—as I
suspected—and get her out of his clutches. Maybe the see-no-evil embassy might
even be prodded into helping an American citizen for a change.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm getting out, to look around a little, but not till
you turn off the engine. I want to be able to use my ears.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right, but don't take all day. This kind of
weather, I want to keep it warm.&quot; He turned to Villatoro and shouted the
order. In the sheets of pounding rain, I figured that no one could have heard
us come in. That, at least, was positive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When the rpm's of the engine had died away, I clicked open
the Bell's wide door, slid it back, and looked around. In the glare of the
landing lights I realized at once that the stones were old, weathered, and
worn, but the grout that sealed them was white and brand new. The plaza was
free of moss, clean as the day it was done—which did not appear to be all that
long ago. Above me, the pyramid, continuous recessed tiers of glistening
stones, towered into the dim sky­line of trees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I stepped out onto the pavement, holding my breath. The plaza
was almost football-field in size, reminding me of an Italian piazza. Around me
the rain was lessening slightly, and as my eyes adjusted . . . my God. There
wasn't just a pyramid here; through the sparkle of raindrops at the edge of the
helicopter's lights I could see what looked like a wide cobblestone walkway
leading into the dense growth just off the edge of the square, probably toward
the south, away from the river, connecting the plaza with distant groups of
small, thatch-roofed houses, set in clusters. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Could Alex Goddard's &quot;miracle&quot; clinic be in some
col­lection of primitive huts? It made no sense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But I decided to try to get a closer look. I'd walked about
thirty feet away from the helicopter, across the slippery pav­ing, when I saw a
flash of lightning in the southeast, followed by a boom of thunder that echoed
over the square.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At least I thought it was thunder. Or maybe the Army was
holding heavy artillery practice somewhere nearby. Abruptly the rain turned
into a renewed torrent, and the next thing I heard was the helicopter's engine
start up again. Then I sensed the main rotor engage, a sudden &quot;whoom,
whoom, whoom&quot; quickly spiraling upward in frequency.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hey! I told him not to—!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I looked back at the Bell's open door, Dupre was
standing there, frantically searching the dark as he heaved out my tan backback
and what looked like a rolled-up sleep­ing bag, both splashing down onto the
rain-soaked paving.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What! For a moment I thought the thunder, or whatever it was,
must have completely freaked him. Then what was actually happening hit me with
a horrifying impact.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alan, wait!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I started dashing back, but now the main rotor was creating a
powerful downdraft, throwing the rain into me like a mon­soon. By the time I
managed to fight my way through the spray, the rotor was on full power and Alan
Dupre and his Bell were already lifting off. I reached up, and just managed to
brush one greasy skid as he churned away straight upward into the rainy night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You shit!&quot; I yelled up, but my final farewell was
lost in the whine of the engine. My God, I thought, watching him disappear,
I've just been abandoned hundreds of miles deep in a Central American rain
forest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then it all sank in. Whoever had gotten to him was playing a
rough game. They didn't want me just to see <i>Baalum</i>, they wanted me
delivered here. Probably to secure me in the same place Sarah was. Colonel Ramos,
or whoever had frightened Dupre into bringing me, had wanted us both. So what
now? Were we both going to be &quot;disappeared&quot;? Staring around at the
pyra­mid and the empty square, I could feel my heart pounding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I tripped over the rolled sleeping bag and sank to my
knees there in the middle of the rain-swept plaza, soaked to the skin and so
angry I was actually trembling. Up above me, Alan Dupre, king of two-timers,
had switched off his landing lights, and a few moments later the hum of the
Bell was swallowed by the night sounds of the forest—the high-pitched din of
crickets, the piercing call of night birds, the basso groan of frogs
celebrating the storm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And something else, an eerie sense of the unnatural. I can't
explain it. Even the night songs of the birds felt omi­nous, the primeval
forest reasserting its will. It was haunting, like nature's mockery of my
desolation. I pounded the sleep­ing bag and felt . . . shit, how did I let this
happen?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Get a grip. I finally stood up and looked around. Maybe when
God wants to do you up right, She gives you what you want. You used Alan Dupre
just like you intended: He got you here. But there's more to the plan of
whoever's holding his puppet strings. So the thing now is, don't let yourself
be manipulated any more. Get off your soggy butt and start taking control of
the situation. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when I sighted a white form at the south, forested
edge of the plaza. What! I ducked down, sure it was somebody lurking there,
waiting to try to beat me to death as they had Sarah. Did Ramos intend to just
murder me immediately?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But there was no getting away. If I could see them, they
surely could see me. And where would I escape to anyway?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I dug my yellow plastic flashlight out of my backpack and my
hand shaking, flicked it on. The beam, however, was just swallowed up in the
rain. All right. I strapped on the pack and taking a deep breath, threw the
rolled sleeping bag over my shoulder and headed across the slippery paving to­ward
the white, which now glistened in the periodic sheets of distant lightning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Meet them straight on. Try and bluff.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I got closer, though, I realized what I was seeing was
actually just the skin of a jaguar, bleached white, the head still on, fearsome
teeth bared which had been hung beside the paved pathway. Thank God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But then, playing my light over it, I thought, Bad sign. My
first encounter at <i>Baalum</i> is with a spooky, dead cat. It felt like a
chilling omen of . . . I wasn't sure what.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I studied it a moment longer with my flashlight, shivering,
then turned and headed quickly across the plaza toward the pyramid now barely
visible in the rain. If there were jaguars, or God knows what else, around I
figured I'd be safer up at the top.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I reached the base and shined my light up the steps, I
saw they were steeper than I'd thought, but they also looked to be part of some
meticulous restoration and brand-new, probably safe to climb. And there at the
top was a stone hut, complete with what appeared to be a roof. Good. If there
hadn't been anything taller than it around I think I might have just climbed a
tree.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On the way up I began trying to digest what the place really
was. The pyramid was &quot;fake&quot;. . . or was it? A hundred years ago the
eccentric Brit archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans whimsically &quot;reconstructed&quot;
the Palace of Minos on Crete with his own money, and it's still a tourist
highlight. So why couldn't somebody do the same with a reclaimed Mayan pyramid
in Central America? Still, this was different, had the feel of being somebody's
crazed obsession.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I topped the steps, I realized the building that crowned
the pyramid was also a &quot;restoration&quot; like everything else, including
a decorated wooden lintel above the door that looked to be newly lacquered.
Bizarre.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I moved through the door and unloaded my gear, then extracted
my water bottle, now half-empty, for a pull. Finally I unrolled Alan Dupre's
sleeping bag on the (dry) stone floor, removed and spread out my wet clothes,
peed off the edge, then took a new pair of underpants, jeans, and shirt out of
my backpack, donned them, and uneasily crawled in. I was shivering—whether from
the soaking rain or from fright, I didn't know—and my teeth were trying to
chatter. Was I hidden away enough to be safe? I didn't know. All I did know
was, I was in something deeper than I'd ever been in my life, and I had no idea
how I was going to get out. And I was both scared to death and angry as hell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sarah was here, though, I was certain. Like a sixth sense, I
could feel her presence, out there somewhere in the rain. For a moment I was
tempted to just plunge into the storm looking for her, but a split second's
reflection told me that was the stupidest thing I could do. Instead, I should
try and get some rest, till the storm cleared, and keep periodic watch on the
plaza in case somebody showed up. Then, the minute there was light, I'd hit the
ground and go find her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I suppose nothing ever happens the way you plan. My mind was
racing and my nerves were in the red, but I was so exhausted from the
teeth-rattling trip in the Bell I couldn't really stay alert very long. In
spite of myself, I eventually drifted off into a dreamless doze, a victim of
the narcotic song of wind in the giant Cebia trees and the insistent drum­ming
of forest rain on the roof.</span></p>

<h2><a name=bookmark22>Chapter Twenty</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='color:windowtext'>I</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> awoke as a sliver of sun flashed
through the stone door­way of the room and forest birds erupted around me in
cele­bration. As I pulled myself up and moved over to the opening, a quick
tropical glare burned into my face. My God, the dawn was electric; it was the
purest blue I'd ever seen, a swath of artist's cobalt. An azure radiance from
the sky glis­tened off the rain forest leaves around me. Had I dreamed the
stormy, haunted world of the night before?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I looked down, everywhere below me was a bank of dense,
pastel mist. Was the plaza really there or had I imagined it? I felt like the
top of the pyramid was floating on a cloud.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Babylon.&quot; That was what Sarah had called this
place. Ancient and mysterious. I took a breath of the morning air and wondered
what would draw her back here. Was <i>Baalum </i>the ultimate escape from her
other life? Even so . . . why would she want to return after somebody had tried
to murder her? What was waiting down there in the fog?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Turning back, I noticed that the room's inside walls were
embossed with rows and rows of classic Mayan glyphs, like little cartoon faces,
all molded in newly set plaster. To my groggy sight they seemed playful,
harmless little caricatures, though next to them were raised bas-reliefs of
warriors in battle dress. It was both sublimely austere and eerie, even creepy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I knelt down and rolled my sleeping bag, trying to clear my
head. Then I stuffed my still-moist clothes into my back­pack and thought about
the river, the Rio Tigre, down some­where at the back of the pyramid. And I
felt my pulse rate edging up. The first thing I wanted to do was see it in the
light of day. It had been Sarah's way out, the only thing I knew for sure she'd
touched.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Get going and do it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I headed through the rear door and down the back steps. When
I reached the ground, the dense forest closed in around me, but I was certain
the river lay dead ahead, through the tangle of trees. As I moved down a path
that grew ever steeper, the canopy up above thickened, arching over me till it
blotted out the pure blue of the sky. And the air was filled with nature
sounds—birdcalls, trills, songs, and clacks, all mingled with the hum and buzz
of insects. Then suddenly, from somewhere up in the canopy, a pack of
screeching spi­der monkeys began flinging rotten mangos down in my di­rection.
I also thought I heard the asthmatic, territorial roar of a giant howler
monkey, the lord of the upper jungle. And what about snakes? I kept an eye on
the vines and tendrils alongside the path, expecting any moment to stumble
across a deadly fer-de-lance, a little red-and-black operator whose poison
heads straight for your nervous system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On the other hand, the birds, the forest birds, were
everywhere, scarlet macaws and keel-billed toucans and darting flocks of Amazon
parrots, brilliant and iridescent, their sweeping tails a psychedelic rainbow
of green, yellow, red. Then the next thing I knew, the path I was on abruptly
opened onto a mossy expanse of pea-soup green, surely the Rio Ti­gre, and . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God, those dark-brown bumps scattered every­where . . .
they're the eyes and snouts of . . . yes, crocodiles, lurking there in wait,
hoping I'm dumb enough to wade in. Forget what Alan Dupre said. This is
definitely not &quot;Dis­neyland.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I glanced upstream and caught sight of a string of
mahogany dugout canoes tied along the shore. They were huge, about fifteen feet
long and three feet wide, and clearly designed to be crocodile-resistant. They
. . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Wait a minute. Lou said Sarah was found in a dugout canoe
that had drifted all the way down the Rio Tigre to where it joins the
Usumacinta. One more clue she might have been here. Maybe I was closing in. <i>Yes!</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I glared back at the crocodiles' unblinking reptile eyes and
tried to get my mind around the fact Sarah could have stood right where I was
standing, or been set adrift from here in a coma, to float downstream. Seeing
that vision, I felt un­bidden tears trailing down my cheeks. And the questions
I had kept piling up. Was this the location of Alex Goddard's
&quot;miracle&quot; clinic? Why was <i>Baalum </i>such a high-security se­cret?
What was the connection between this place and Sarah's ravaged mind and body? I
wanted to know all of it, and by God I would.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This was the farthest I'd ever been from
&quot;civilization,&quot; though I was trying not to let that fact sink in too
deeply. The water was green and full of small aquatic creations, but I managed
to find a reasonably un-mossy spot and—still keeping an eye on the leering
crocodiles—splashed my face. It felt good, even if it was filthy. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay, I'd seen enough of the river. I raised up and
stretched. Time to go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My hopes at war with my nerves, I turned my back on the
scummy, fetid Rio Tigre and headed back up the jungle trail toward the plaza.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I got there, I was struck all over again by the vision
of the pyramid. Something like it might have been here origi­nally, but in any
case it had been completely redone, with newly cut yellowish stones and white
lime plaster, an exotic castle nestled in the green lap of the rain forest,
rising above the square like a haunting presence. It must have been well over a
hundred feet high, a stone wedding cake with a dozen steep tiers between the
ground and the platform at the top, which also was square and roughly fifteen
feet on the side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Standing there gazing at it, I think I'd never felt more
disoriented. Sarah, Sarah, how could we both end up here, at the last outpost
of the known world? But seeing is believ­ing. I took a deep breath, then turned
down the pathway toward the thatch-roofed huts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Through the mist it was gradually becoming clear that <i>Baalum</i>
actually was a village, and a sizable one. The walk­way led past a string of
clearings, each with clusters of one-room huts built in the ancient, classical
style, with walls of mud over rows of vertical saplings, their roofs and
porches peaked with yellow-green thatch weathering to browns and grays. The
structures, outlined starkly against the towering green arbor of the forest
above, were grouped around paved patios. It all was neat and meticulous, like a
jungle Brigadoon. Although the effects of the storm were every­where—blown
thatch and bamboo—I still felt as if I'd fallen into a time warp where clocks
had gone backward. What . . . ?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I began to catch the outlines of people, as though they
had materialized out of the pale fog. All pure Maya, short and brown, shiny
black hair, they appeared to be just going about their daily lives. I was
approaching a workshop area where, under a wide thatch shade, men with
chipped-flint adzes were carving bowls, plows, various implements from mahogany
and other rain forest woods. Next to them, potters were fashioning brown clay
jugs. They all were wear­ing white loincloths and a large square cotton cloth
knotted around their shoulders, their hair tied back in dense ponytails. It
must have been how the Maya looked a thousand years ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Their earnestness reminded me of the villagers I once filmed
in the Yucatan for the Discovery Channel—with one big difference: There I was
the big-shot gringo; here I felt like a powerless time traveler. The sense of
being lost in another age was as compelling as the &quot;colonial&quot; mock-up
at Williamsburg, but this was real and it was decidedly spooky.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally one of the men looked up and noticed me. Our eyes
locked for an instant—it seemed like forever—and then he reached over and, in a
way that seemed breathless, shook the man next to him, gesturing toward me.
Together they gazed back as though viewing a phantom, their brown faces intent,
and then they turned and called out to the others, alerting them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What are they going to do with me? I wondered with a sudden
chill. A stranger here in their hideaway midst. Would they just turn on me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Find some women. Get off the street.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I turned and headed as fast as I could down the cobble­stone
central path, till I saw a cluster of females on a white­washed stone porch,
long hair falling over their shoulders as they bent to their tasks beneath the
thatch overhangs. Some were stirring rugged clay pots of corn soaking in lime;
others were grinding the softened maize to tortilla thinness on wide granite
platters. Behind them was another group that ap­peared to be part of a sewing
commune, young wives busy at their back-strap looms, layering thread after
thread of dyed cotton. None of them was wearing a <i>huipil</i>—the traditional
multicolored blouse I'd remembered from the waitresses in the restaurant.
Instead, they all had on a kind of handloom-woven white shift I'd never seen
before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Talk to them. Let them know you're no threat to anybody.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I moved down the hard clay pathway toward them, two looked
up and took notice. Their first reaction seemed to be alarm, as they tensed and
stared. But then I tried a smile and it seemed to work. Their looks turned to
puzzlement, then embarrassed grins, as though they wanted to be friendly but
weren't sure how to acknowledge my presence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I reached the porch, several reached out to touch me.
One older woman, short and wizened and extremely brown, even tried to stroke my
hair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What was going on? I was taken aback, but I also was
determined to get through to them. Why not just ask them point-blank if Sarah's
here? Is there any chance they under­stand Spanish?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Buenos dias</i>.&quot; I smiled and nodded. &quot;<i>Dispenseme.
Quiero descubrir . . . esta una gringa de los Estados Unidos aqui? </i>&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>They all returned uncomprehending looks, then
glanced quickly at each other in confusion. Or at least that was how I read
their faces.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sarah,&quot; I said, pronouncing the name slowly.
&quot;Sarah Crenshaw.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sara,&quot; one voiced, then others. They backed away
and immediately began a heated dispute, which eventually in­volved all the
women. Well, one thing was for sure: They damned well knew who I was asking
about. But why were they so upset? Next, several of them grew testy, pointing
at me as they continued to argue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally the two I'd first approached turned and began urg­ing
me to leave, gesturing at me with their hands as though sweeping me out of the
compound. Yes, there was no mis­taking. I was being dismissed. And I detected
an odd ner­vousness as they glanced around, seemingly worried somebody might
catch me there with them. I got the feeling they'd finally decided they didn't
want me anywhere near them, since they kept pointing down the thoroughfare in
the direction of the pyramid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I've blown it, I thought. They must have figured out I'm here
to get her and decided they no longer want to have anything to do with me. What
did that mean?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And now what do I do? As I retreated back out to the main
walkway, I felt a growing sense of defeat. Then, looking down it, I realized
I'd literally been going in a circle. It was actually a large oval that curved
back to the main square and the pyramid, where I'd started from.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>God, what a nightmare. I obviously had to rethink my game
plan, find a way to communicate. And on top of that, I was dying of thirst.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I fished out the almost-empty plastic container from my
backpack, then walked across the square and settled myself on the first step
leading up the steep front. As I drew on the bottle, my mind still swirling, I
happened to notice an upright stone slab off to the side, like a tall, thin
tombstone, with a bas-relief of a Maya warrior on it, next to some kind of
two-headed serpent god—probably Kukulkan, one of the few Maya deities I knew.
And then, down the side, were rows of lines and dots. I studied them a minute
before realizing it was the classical Mayan number system, telling precisely
when things happened to the ruler shown there: born on such and such a date,
assumed the kingship, won great battles, etc., all carefully dated as career
high-points. I knew that dots represented single years, horizontal lines the
number five. The Maya loved numbers and numerology, so . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when I glanced up to see a group of women
approaching slowly across the square, with a bunch of the men watching from the
forest arbors beyond, and they were huddled around something they were
carrying. Whatever it was, they seemed to be delivering it to me. Then I
realized they were the same ones who'd just kicked me out of their compound.
What next? Are they coming to drive me from the plaza too? Should I try and
forcibly search all the huts?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But then they set down their load—it turned out to be a crude
bamboo-and-thatch palanquin—and stepped aside as they beckoned me forward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For a moment I just stared, disbelieving. I felt like I was
seeing someone I didn't want to recognize, perhaps because that someone looked
so much like me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgy, they told me a new one was here, and I hoped it
was you.&quot; Sarah was swinging her skinny legs off the side, her voice
bright. Her face was drawn, but her hair was neat and her eyes were radiant.
&quot;Isn't <i>Baalum</i> the most wonderful place you've ever seen?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was wearing a white shift that reminded me of the blue
hospital smock she'd had on the last time I saw her, except here it seemed more
like something that had a special significance, like the robes of an acolyte.
Her shoes were soft brown slippers that looked brand-new, and around her waist
was a braided leather band. As I stared at her, I won­dered if she was really
as transformed as she looked. She was undeniably stronger than two days ago, in
spite of what that bastard Alex Goddard and his Guatemalan Army cronies had
done to her to get her here. But still, she had to be half dead. Thank God Lou
couldn't see her now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sar, oh, Sar.&quot; I rushed over and threw my arms
around her. She'd been freshly bathed and perfumed—a fragrance like
chocolate—but she felt like a bag of bones. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was afraid <i>Baalum</i> was all just a dream.&quot;
She hugged me back, then started rising to her feet. God, could she walk?
&quot;But now I remember everything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sar, I've come to take you home.&quot; I grasped her
hand, warm and soft, to help her stand—though it wasn't necessary. &quot;You're
not safe—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, it's wonderful now&quot; Then she turned and said
some­thing to one of the women. It took me a moment to realize she was speaking
their language; I guessed it was Kekchi Maya.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was stunned. How did she learn it? Finally she looked back
at me and switched to English again. &quot;I didn't under­stand before. I was .
. . sick so much.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sar, come on.&quot; I slipped my arm around her.
&quot;We're going to get you out of here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'd never felt so helpless. Alan Dupre had said there was a
road, but it was controlled by the Army. Right now, I didn't even know where it
was. Maybe I could find a phone, or radio. Call the embassy. There must be
something. Alex God­dard has to be here somewhere, but he's not going to stop
me. I'll strangle him if he tries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I hugged her again, the feel of her skin-and-bones frame making
my soul ache. But most hurtful of all, I wasn't sure she would want to leave.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sar, can you understand me?&quot; I tried to catch her
deep blue eyes. &quot;I'm taking you home. Your father's very worried about
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mention of Lou seemed to finally get through to her. She
turned and examined me with a quizzical look, and then her eyes hardened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgy, he was never there for me.&quot; Her voice was
filled with certainty, and pain. &quot;But when I went to see Dr. God­dard he
let me come here for the ceremony. It's so spiritual. After—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sar, come on.&quot; What did she mean by
&quot;ceremony&quot;? Whatever it was, I had to get her out of this place.
Immedi­ately. &quot;We've—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you here for the ceremony?&quot; Her face flooded
with renewed joy. &quot;It's two days from now. Maybe he'll let you—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She should be resting.&quot; It was a harsh voice,
directly behind us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I recoiled, then whirled around. Three men were standing
there, two of them young privates in uniforms of the Gua­temalan Army and
carrying AK-47 assault rifles, the ones with the long, ominous curved clip
Steve called <i>cuerno de cabrio</i>, the &quot;horn of the goat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The third was in a black sweatshirt and black jeans, his long
salt-and-pepper hair tied back in a ponytail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They should have known better than to bring her out
here,&quot; Alex Goddard said. &quot;Not in her condition.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The bastard. It was all coming together in my mind. He'd
tried to kill her once before, and now he was going to finish the job. But he'd
have to kill me first.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm here to take her home.&quot; I marched up to him.
&quot;You're not about to get away with kidnapping. I'm going to get the
embassy to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She's here for important medical reasons.&quot; He met
my eyes. &quot;I hope you'll allow me the opportunity to help her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean, 'help'?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll explain if you'll give me a chance.&quot; He
revolved and delivered some brusque orders in Kekchi Maya to the women, who
nodded apologetically and began helping Sarah back onto the palanquin. After he
admonished her in the same language, he then said something in quick Spanish to
the two young Army privates, who gave him a firm salute, turned, and walked
over to pick the palanquin up, to carry it for the women. The sense of
authority he exuded reminded me of that first morning we met at Quetzal Manor.
His eyes flashed from benign to demanding to benign in an instant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, damn it, <i>alto</i>!&quot; I strode over, shoved
the soldiers aside, and took her hand. &quot;Sar, honey, don't you understand
what's going on? Something terrible happened to you when you were here before.
I'm so worried—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But he says I need to stay, Morgy.&quot; She drew back.
&quot;It's best. He's helping me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I watched the two privates carry her away, down the
cobblestone pathway, AK-47's swung over their shoulders, I felt my helplessness
become complete. The Army here was under his control, just like everything
else.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How was I going to tell Lou about this, that Sarah had been
brainwashed? Whatever Alex Goddard had done to her had turned her into some
kind of &quot;Moonie,&quot; ready to de­nounce her own father. So now did I
have two battles to wage: one with Alex Goddard and one with her?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he walked over to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not going to ask how you got here, though I assume
it wasn't easy.&quot; He smiled, like a kindly priest, and put his hand on my
shoulder. &quot;But however you did it, I'm glad you decided to come. It's
important for you to be here. She needs you now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<h2><a name=bookmark23>Chapter Twenty-one</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;</span><b><span style='color:windowtext'>C</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>ut the crap.&quot; I pulled away,
still in shock from seeing Sarah so addled. I wanted more than anything else in
the world just to slug him. &quot;Why did you bring her here? Think about your
answer. Kidnapping is a serious crime in the States.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've been very concerned about her.&quot; He looked up
at the groves of Cebia trees around the square, a quiet glance, as though to
inhale the misty morning air. My legal threat had gone right past him—probably
because here he was the only law. &quot;But now she's receiving the treatment
she needs. I expect she'll be fine before long.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Treatment?&quot; I was caught off guard. Okay, let's
start get­ting things straight. &quot;When she was here before, somebody tried
to beat her to death. How—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What happened then was beyond my control.&quot; He mo­tioned
me to join him as he settled onto the first step of the pyramid sadness in his
eyes. We were alone in the square now, and I felt like I'd become his personal
prisoner, trapped. &quot;Sarah was . . . is very dear to me. I care for her
deeply.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You cared so much for her she ended up in a coma, over
on the Mexican border.&quot; I didn't sit. Instead I just bored in, hoping to
stare him down, but his eyes had grown distant, that little trick he had of
alternating between intimacy and remoteness. Again it reminded me of that first
morning we'd met, looking out over the bluffs of the Hudson.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you'll let me, I'd like to try and tell you
something of the circumstances surrounding that tragedy.&quot; He was gazing
off in the direction the women had gone. &quot;You see, when Sarah first
appeared at Quetzal Manor in New York, she was a very troubled young woman. She
declared she was a person of pure spirit and she wanted to have a baby without
so much as touching a man, some procedure that would produce a divine child
created of cosmic energy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Cosmic energy. I had a flashback, hearing the words, to the
time when she'd just turned six and we'd been sent by my mother to the hayloft
to track down nests secreted there by rogue chicken hens. When we came across a
cache of eggs, she asked if baby chicks came out of them. I assured her they
did, and then she asked if human babies came from eggs too. My biology was
pretty thin, but I told her I sup­posed they did, sort of, but then the eggs
were probably hatched, or something, before babies were born. She thought about
that a moment, scrunching up her face, then declared &quot;No!&quot; and
bitterly began smashing the eggs. Babies and all living things came from
another world, she declared, a spe­cial place we could not see. They came
directly from God. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was why she would seek out someone like Alex Goddard.
For her, he must have seemed a messenger of the Unseen. Who better to create a
child for her? The ironic part was, I'd found him for almost the same reason,
seeking a miracle when all else had failed. Were Sarah and I even more alike
than I'd realized?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So I began trying to work with her.&quot; He was
turning back to me. &quot;But then I discovered she'd been born with an
abnormality of the uterus. It has a medical name, but suffice to say it's very
rare, and afflicts only about one woman in twenty thousand. Even after my
diagnosis, though, she re­fused to give up. She was a person of enormous
tenacity.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>God, I thought. Why didn't she come home to us, to Lou</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>and me? We
loved her. I felt my guilt go out to her all over again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She next declared she wanted to come here to <i>Baalum</i>,
to the place of miracles. I told her that, yes, miracles can sometimes
transpire here, but only at a great price. We would need to have an agreement
and she would have to keep it no matter what.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean, an agree—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Truthfully, though,&quot; he went on, ignoring me,
&quot;I imme­diately regretted the offer, since I realized she was far too
unstable for this . . . environment. Finally I forbade her to come, but just
before my next scheduled trip she found out and booked herself on the same
flight. There was literally nothing I could do to stop her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She put Ninos del Mundo on her landing card.&quot; I
was growing sick to my stomach at the rehearsed way he was recounting her
story. &quot;That's this place, right? <i>Baalum</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;My clinic here is known by that name. The
village itself is called Baalum.&quot; He was easily meeting my eye, holding
his own in our battle of wills. &quot;Sarah was, I have to say, a very
impressionable young person. Once here, she forgot all about her purpose for
coming. She should have stayed up the hill there&quot;—he was pointing off to
the south—&quot;where I could care for her, but instead she moved down here,
into the compounds. Then she discovered a hallucinogenic sub­stance they have
here, began using it heavily, and I think it tipped her into a form of
dementia.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So, she was doing drugs, something I'd always secretly
feared. Well, maybe she was still having flashbacks of some kind; maybe that
explained why she was off in another world when she came out of her coma.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What . . . kind of 'hallucinogenic substance'?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>He
sighed then shrugged and answered. &quot;Here in the rain forest there's an
ugly three-pound toad the <i>Bufo marinus</i>—you'll see them around, near
sunset—that has glands down its back that excrete a milky white poison.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I knew about them. They were migrating north now, even into
Florida. They were huge and looked like Jabba the Hutt in Star Wars. I hate
toads of all varieties, but the thought of those monsters made me shudder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My God, isn't their toxin lethal?&quot; Was Sarah
trying to destroy herself? Was that why her mind was so blitzed? &quot;I've
heard—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, it can kill you, but it can also—if processed cor­rectly,
with fermented honey—give you truly supernatural visions. The classical Maya
used it for ceremonial purposes. I'd managed to reconstruct how they prepared
it, and—some­thing I now deeply regret—I showed the shamans here how to
replicate the procedure. At the time it was just a minor part of my research
into traditional pharmacology, but she heard about it and persuaded them to
give her a vial. Then more and more.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That did sound like Sarah. Always out on the edge, testing
new realities. But then I thought a moment about what he'd actually said. Some
of the people here in his &quot;place of mir­acles&quot; were doing heavy
drugs, and she'd got caught up in it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why didn't you stop her?&quot; You unfeeling
bastard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I tried, believe me. But I'm afraid she was far past lis­tening
to me. By then she was learning the Kekchi Maya dialect, becoming totally
immersed in their world. She began having episodes of complete non-rationality,
and then one day she told the women in her compound she was going over to
Palenque, the Maya ruins in Mexico. It's where the classical Maya held their
last kingship ceremony. Before anyone re­alized she was serious, she stole one
of their <i>cayucos</i>, their mahogany dugout canoes, and headed down the Rio
Tigre.&quot; His eyes had turned completely dark, the way he used to blank them
out. &quot;She just went missing. Everyone here was devastated. We all loved
her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I stood there weighing his story. It didn't ring true. I sup­posed
she was capable of something that crazy, but would she have actually done it? I
didn't think so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I remembered something else he'd said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You said you proposed an 'agreement.' What was that
about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stared at me. &quot;It's nothing that need concern us. Suf­fice
to say I kept my part. Anyway, it's over and past now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why wouldn't he tell me? Did she make some bargain with the
Devil?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But regarding Sarah,&quot; he went on, &quot;I only
just learned she'd been found and brought to New York in a coma. Want­ing to do
what I could, I immediately called the hospital and, out of professional
courtesy, they told me she'd shown early stages of coming out of it, but she
appeared to be halluci­nating. It was exactly what I'd feared. . . .&quot; His
voice trailed off. &quot;I hope I did the right thing, but when I learned she'd
been released, I arranged for her to be brought back here, where perhaps I can
do something for her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In rare cases, the hallucinogen she took permanently al­ters
critical synapses in the brain. I'm fearful she may have abused it to the
extent something like that could have oc­curred. No one in the U.S. would have
the slightest idea what to do, but I think I may know of an herbal antidote
they turned to in ancient times that can repair at least part of the damage. I
also knew that getting her back here through nor­mal channels would be impossible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So you had Colonel Ramos and a bunch of his Guate­malan
thugs just break in and take her?&quot; I didn't know which part of the story
horrified, and angered, me the most.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have the misfortune to know him reasonably well, and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>I explained
it was very important to me, and he agreed to assist. I honestly didn't know
where else to turn. I understand there may have been some violence, for which I
apologize, but these people have their own way of doing things.&quot; He rose
and came over and put his hand on my shoulder. &quot;I hope you'll
understand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The son of a bitch was coming on oily and contrite, when he'd
just subcontracted an outright kidnapping. I wanted to kill him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally I walked away, trying to get a grip on my anger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, that bastard also broke into my apartment and
stole a reel of a picture I'm shooting.&quot; I turned back. &quot;I've also
got a strong feeling he's the one who just threatened one of the women I
filmed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, if that happened, then let me say welcome to the
paranoid harassment of the Guatemalan high command.&quot; He sighed against the
morning sound of birds chirping all around us. &quot;Unfortunately, I gather
they've assumed you're documenting the operations of Children of Light in some
way, doing a movie.&quot; His eyes drifted off into space, as though seeking a
refuge. &quot;You see, my project up here in the Peten is to carry out
pharmaceutical research with as few distractions as possible. But in Guatemala
City, I have what is, in effect, a hospice for girls in trouble—which is also
called Niiios del Mundo, by the way—that's connected with my U.S. adoption
service, Children of Light. However, any time Niiios del Mundo takes in an
orphaned or abandoned infant and tries to provide it with a loving home through
adoption in the States, the government here always threatens to hold up the
paperwork if I don't give a bribe, what they call an 'expediting fee.' So if
you were to probe too deeply . . . Let me just say it's not something they'd
care to see lead off 60 Minutes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It sounded like more BS, but I couldn't prove that. Yet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, why don't you just clear that up, and then I'll
take Sarah and—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But I've only now initiated her treatment. Surely you
want to give it a chance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I looked out at the rain forest. This was the place she'd
come to once, and—though I'd never admit it to Alex God­dard—it was the place
she'd announced she wanted to return to. But something devastating had happened
to her mind here. What should I do?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The fact was, I didn't trust Alex Goddard any farther than I
could throw him. I had to get Sarah and get us both out of here as soon as
possible, though that meant I'd have to neu­tralize him and the Army, and then
use my limited American dollars to try to buy our way back to Guatemala City.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But come.&quot; He turned his gaze toward the south.
&quot;Let me show you the thing I'm proudest of here. It's just up there.&quot;
He was pointing toward a dense section of the rain forest, in the opposite
direction from the river and up a steep incline.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I couldn't see anything but trees, but then I still had the
feeling I'd stepped through the looking glass and found Sarah trapped there.
The next thing I knew, we were on an uphill forest trail, headed due south.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think it's time you told me what's going on back
there in the village,&quot; I said. What was it about this place that had
seized such a claim on Sarah's mind?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Baalum</i> is difficult to explain to someone
encountering it for the first time.&quot; He paused. &quot;Much of it is
so—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think I can handle it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You have every right to know, but I don't really know
where to start.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How about the beginning?&quot; Why was he being so
ambiguous?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Very well.&quot; He was taking out a pair of gray
sunglasses,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>as though to
gain time. &quot;It actually goes back about ten years ago, when I was
prospecting for rainforest plants up here in the Peten and accidentally
stumbled across this isolated village, which clearly had been here since
classical times. I immediately noticed a huge mound of dirt everybody said was
haunted by 'the Old Ones,' and I knew right away it had to be a buried pyramid.
They're more common down here than you'd think. So I struck a bargain with the
village elders and acquired the site. But after I unearthed it and began the
restoration, I became inspired with a vision. One day I found myself offering
to restore anything else they could find—which eventually included, by the way,
a magnificent old steam bath—in exchange for which they would help me by
undertaking a grand experiment, a return to their traditional way of
life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So you deliberately closed them off to the modern world?&quot;
It told me Alex Goddard could control a Mayan village just as he controlled
everything else he touched. It also confirmed he had a weakness for the
grandiose gesture. Would a time come when I could exploit that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I told them that together we would try to recreate the
time of their glory, and perhaps in so doing we could also rediscover its
long-lost spirit, and wisdom. On the practical side, they would help me by
bringing me the rare plants I needed to try and rediscover the lost Native
American phar­macologies, and in return I would build them a clinic where
families can come for modern pediatric and public-health services. So <i>Baalum
</i>became a project we share together. I call it a miracle.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That still didn't begin to explain why it felt so eerie. Some­thing
else was going on just under the surface. What was he really doing here?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the path uphill abruptly opened onto a clearing in which
sat a large two-story building, its color a dazzling white, most likely plaster
over cinder block, with a thatch roof and a wide, ornate mahogany door at the
front. The building was nestled in a grove of trees whose vines and tendrils
had embraced it so thoroughly, there was no telling how far it extended back
into the forest. There also was a parking lot, paved and fed by a
well-maintained gravel road leading south.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Seeing it, I felt an immediate wave of relief. Even better,
the lot itself contained half-a-dozen well-worn pickup trucks, while sunburned
Maya men were lounging in the shade of a nearby tree and smoking cigarettes.
They were not from Baalum. They wore machine-made clothes and they were
speaking Spanish, unlike the men in loincloths down in the village.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes! That's how I can get us out of here. A few dollars . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Parked there also was a tan Humvee, the ultimate all-road
vehicle, which I assumed belonged to Alex Goddard. Maybe I should just try to
steal it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As we passed through the door and into the vestibule of the
building, I glimpsed a cluster of Maya women and chil­dren crowded into a
brilliantly lit reception area. Goddard smiled and waved at them, and several
nodded back, timor­ously and with enormous reverence. They were being at­tended
by a dark-eyed, attractive Maya woman in a blue uniform—the name lettered on
her blouse was Marcelina— who was holding a tray of vials and hypodermic
needles. She was pure <i>indigena</i>, all of five feet tall, with broad cheek­bones
and deep-set penetrating eyes. Unlike the other women in the room, however,
there was no air of resignation about her. She was full of authority, a
palpable inner fire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;One of my most successful programs here&quot;—he nodded
a greeting to her—&quot;is to provide free vaccinations and gen­eral health
resources for the villages in this part of the Peten Department.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I thought USAID already had public-health projects in
Guatemala.&quot; The sight deeply depressed me. They all looked so poignant,
the women with their shabby <i>huipils</i> and lined faces, the children even
more disheartening, sad waifs with runny noses and watery eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which confirmed again that they'd come in the pickups parked
outside, driven here by the men.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I had six hundred cash in dollars. I could just buy one of
those worn-out junkers for that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alex Goddard glanced around, as though reluctant to re­spond
in the presence of all the Maya.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You saw those 'security guards' down there just now.
They're nothing but boys with guns, 'recruits' kidnapped by the government on
market day and pressed into the Army. They're all around here. The powers that
be in Guatemala City are very threatened by what I'm achieving, so they've got
these Army kids hanging around, keeping an eye on me. They also hate the fact I
can provide health services better than they can. But to answer your question,
most of the AID money gets soaked up by the bureaucracy in Guatemala City, so
the people up here have learned to rely on me. The Army, however, despises me
and everything I'm doing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What a load of BS. You just admitted you had an inside track
with Colonel Alvino Ramos. Anybody can see Children of Light or Ninos del
Mundo, or whatever the hell other aliases you use, is thick as thieves with the
Guatemalan Armed Forces. Don't insult my intelligence. It just makes me
furious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I turned to Marcelina. She'd begun passing out hard-sugar
candies to the mesmerized children, showing them how to remove the cellophane
before putting them into their mouths. Though she was pure Maya, she looked
educated. I instinc­tively liked her. Maybe she could tell me what was really
going on here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you speak English?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes.&quot; She was gazing at me with a blend of
curiosity and concern. &quot;If—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've got a procedure scheduled shortly,&quot; Goddard
inter­jected, urging me on down the tiled hallway. &quot;But I need to take a
moment and recharge. Come with me and we can talk some more.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Near the end of the hall, we entered a spacious,
country-style kitchen. He walked over and opened the refrigerator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Care for a little something to eat?&quot; He looked
back, speckled white hair swinging across his shoulders as his ponytail came
loose. &quot;I had Marcelina whip up some gazpacho last night and I see there's
some left. It's my own secret rec­ipe, special herbs from around here. It's
good and good for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not hungry.&quot; It wasn't true. I was growing
ravenous. But I was repressing the feeling because of everything else that was
going on. His &quot;village&quot; was holding back its secrets, and now his
clinic of &quot;miracles&quot; also felt suspiciously wrong. I'd seen plenty of
rural public-health operations in developing countries, and this setup was far
too big and fancy. The whole thing didn't begin to compute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you like.&quot; He gave an absent shrug.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I looked around and noticed that just off the kitchen was
another space, which was, I realized, his private dining room. There was a
rustic table in the center that looked like it had been carved from the trunk
of a large Cebia tree. I walked in, and moments later he followed carrying a
tray with two calabash bowls of gazpacho and some crusty bread.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In case you change your mind and decide to join
me.&quot; He placed a bowl opposite where he was planning to sit. &quot;Like I
said, there're unusual herbs around here with flavors you've never dreamed
of.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        He
began eating, while behind him I glimpsed Marcelina</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>moving down
the hall, carrying more trays of vaccine and headed out toward the vestibule
again. I had to find a way to talk to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I settled into the rickety chair that faced my plate, I
glanced down and saw a red lumpy mixture with a spray of indefinable green
specks across the top like a scattering of jungle stars. No way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I looked up again, he was swabbing his lips with a white
napkin, his penetrating eyes boring in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now,&quot; he said, &quot;it's time we started
concentrating on you. Got you going with your program.&quot;</span></p>

<h2><a name=bookmark24>Chapter Twenty-two</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;</span><b><span style='color:windowtext'>M</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>y program?&quot; I stared back at
him, feeling a jolt. With my thoughts completely focused on Sarah, the last
thing on my mind was my own baby.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now that you're here&quot;—he smiled—&quot;there's no
reason we shouldn't proceed. This is, after all, a place of miracles.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Right. You let Sarah destroy her mind and now you want me to
. . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Don't even think about it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have to tell you, I'm not overly impressed thus far
with your 'program,' &quot; I said. &quot;First I passed out in your clinic,
and then my doctor in New York told me those drugs Ramala gave me are highly
illegal, and for good reason.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What is 'legal' is more often than not the judgment of
medical reactionaries.&quot; He dismissed the issue with a wave of his hand.
&quot;My work has moved far beyond anything the FDA has ever dreamed of.&quot;
Then his look turned grave. &quot;I hope you'll give me a chance to try to help
you. I've been giving your case a lot of thought since our first examination,
about what we should do. But first let me ask you . . . do you have a partner
who could come here soon?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay, maybe the thing to do was appear to play along for a
while, move under his radar, and then get Sarah and split.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's a possibility.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He smiled again. &quot;Excellent. If this person can come
here</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>to the
clinic for a . . . deposit, then we could put you on a fast-track
schedule.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;One thing at a time. First I'd like to know exactly
what it is you have in mind.&quot; Would his &quot;program&quot; include string­ing
me out on the toad drug, the way he'd done with Sarah?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course.&quot; He leaned forward in his chair.
&quot;I believe that, given your history, an in-vitro procedure would have the
highest chance of success. You undoubtedly know how it works. We remove a
number of eggs by aspiration and grade them for maturity and viability, after
which we fertilize them to begin embryos growing. Then we pick the most
promising for implantation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In vitro is invasive and dangerous and there's a lot
that can go wrong.&quot; I genuinely hated the idea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;To some extent.&quot; He examined his watch for a
moment, then looked up. &quot;But let me just say this. Since any repro­ductive
therapy, particularly in vitro, is strongly dependent on the factor of timing,
I've developed experimental com­pounds down here that can regulate egg
maturities very pre­cisely. It minimizes a lot of uncertainties, which is why
we're so lucky you're . . .&quot; He paused. &quot;Look, the first thing we
need to do is put you on a strict regimen of diet and spiritual discipline,
using my system for regulating your Chi, your energy flows. Then, if you
respond we can start thinking about the procedure. And should you eventually
decide you want to go ahead and you can have your partner come here, we could
possibly have everything done in just a few days.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, you can forget about me taking any 'experimental
compounds.' &quot; How long could I stall him?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgan, there's more to this.&quot; His look grew
pained. &quot;It's awkward to bring it up, but your presence here creates no
small difficulty for me. I told you certain people in the military high command
have concerns about the film you're making. And then the next thing they know,
you show up here. It's just going to heighten their paranoia. But if I can
convince them you're here for fertility treatment . . . In any case, it's
important that nothing you, or I, do is at odds with that presumption. I hope
it's true, but even if you chose to forgo it, I still need to put you on my
normal regimen. You understand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's baloney. Somebody had me brought to <i>Baalum</i>.
Whoever did it knows full well why I'm here. The problem is, I still don't know
what they really want.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, you can say I've come to take Sarah home,&quot; I
told him. &quot;That seems reason enough.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The other story is simpler to explain.&quot; He took a
last bite of gazpacho, then rested his pewter spoon on the table. &quot;Take my
word for it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what if I don't choose to go along with this cha­rade?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We would both be in jeopardy. They're entirely capable
of . . . things I'd rather not have to elaborate on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I sat there, feeling a chill envelop the room. How was I
going to get out of this place?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;By the way, a while ago Sarah mentioned something about
a 'ceremony.' What's that—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's a special time here.&quot; His gaze shifted to the
ceiling. &quot;In fact, it's supposed to take place in three days, but the Army
has informed me it has to be two days from now. That's the day they rotate the
troops here, so there'll be double strength.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why do they need—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Things can get a bit frenzied.&quot; He smiled, though
he seemed to be embarrassed. &quot;However, the people will love the fact
you're here to share it with them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Did he say &quot;frenzied&quot;? My mind immediately flashed
on the Aztec rituals of ripping out beating hearts. But the Maya didn't go to
that extreme, at least so far as I knew. Once again, though, I had the feeling
I was only hearing what he wanted me to know, not the whole truth. It felt like
a chess game where I didn't know the location of all the pieces or how they
could move.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell you what.&quot; He was getting up, turning toward
the hall. &quot;Why don't you let me show you around the clinic? In fact, I'm
scheduled to perform an in vitro this morning for a childless couple here.
You're free to see it. Perhaps that could help you make your own
decision.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well . . . do you have a phone? I need to make some
calls.&quot; Would he let me call out? That would be a first test of what his
intentions were. It was all getting so insidious. I had Sarah to worry about,
and the Army, and now some kind of &quot;ceremony&quot; that he'd managed to
stay cannily vague about. I only knew I wanted the whole world to know where I
was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course,&quot; he said. &quot;You're welcome to use
my office.&quot; He was pointing down the hall. &quot;It's right this
way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes! Maybe I'm not completely his prisoner yet. I still have
privileges. But I'd damned well better use them while I can.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I walked out and felt a breeze, and then I studied the far
end of the hallway, at the opposite end from the entrance, and noticed huge
slatted windows. As we walked in their direction, I realized there was a
stairway on one side, at the end of the hall, leading up to the second story of
the building.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's up there?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hygenic nursery rooms.&quot; He glanced at the stairs.
&quot;Un­like U.S. practice, new mothers here aren't sent home after a day or
two. Women and their newborns are encouraged to stay here at the clinic for at
least a week. It's actually very much a part of their tradition, a period of
bonding. You're welcome to visit with them later if you like.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I intended to. In fact, I found myself looking around and
trying to memorize everything about the place. A two-story building, a marble
stair, a nursery upstairs, downstairs rooms along either side of the hallway
(what was in them?), and an office I was about to see. Could the clinic be
locked down? What were the escape routes? How closely was the Army watching?
The time would come, I was sure, when I'd need every scrap of intelligence I
could collect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When we reached the end of the hall, the fresh cool wind
still blowing against my face, he stopped in front of a large, ornate wooden
door with a brass knob in the very center. There was no sign of a lock, just a
sense of great gravity about its purpose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The phone's in here.&quot; He pushed the door and it
slowly swung inward on hinges that must have required ball bear­ings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was indeed an office, dimly lighted by the moving
screen-savers of two computers, each on a separate desk. He flicked on the
overhead lights and I noticed that one com­puter was hooked to a fax machine,
the other to a separate printer. An impressive assembly of data-management tech­nology
for out here in the rain forest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I focused on the central desk, on which sat an open,
briefcase-looking box containing a mini-console labeled Magellan World Phone. A
small satellite dish was bolted down next to it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It uplinks to the Inmarsat Series 3 geostationary satel­lites.&quot;
He indicated the dish. &quot;But it works like a regular phone. The
international codes all apply.&quot; Then he turned to leave. &quot;I should be
ready for the procedure in a few min­utes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I picked up the handset and flicked it on. Three green diodes
flashed, then two yellow ones, after which a white light came on and I heard a
continuous hum, a dial tone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hooray. But was his satellite phone tapped? Why would he let
me just call out? Was this a feint in our game of cat-and-mouse, just to lull
me into believing everything here was safe and benign? Remembering Sarah's drug
experience, I already knew that couldn't be true. For now, though, I had to get
an SOS out while I had the chance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'd long since memorized the number of Steve's hotel in
Belize City, and if I could reach him, he could go the em­bassy in Guatemala
City and . . . I wasn't sure what. I still hoped to get out of here on my own,
but if that failed . . . maybe some of those sturdy Marines . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I dialed the Belize number, however, the phone just rang
and rang.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Come on. Somebody please pick up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then they did. Thank goodness. But when I asked for Steve—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So sorry, mon,&quot; came the proud Caribbean voice,
&quot;but Mr. Abrams check out Monday. Early in the morning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right, I know that. But he came back last night, didn't
he?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, mon. He say he be coming back, to hold his room,
but—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He didn't come back?&quot; I felt my palms go icy. Who
was going to know where Sarah and I were? &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He not coming back here, mon.&quot; The man paused and
mumbled something to another clerk, then came back on. &quot;Nobody seen him
since. You want leave a message, that's okay. But I don't know when—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No.&quot; I didn't know what to say. The implication
was only gradually sinking in. &quot;No message. Thanks anyway. I'll try back
later.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Any time, mon. No problem.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I hung up, trying to stay calm. Steve, where are you?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay, I told myself, you don't actually know something's
wrong. It could be anything. Still, it was very worrying. Steve, my one and
only . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>       I was staring at the phone, wondering what my next
move should be. Whatever else, I've got to try to reach Lou, tell him I've
found Sarah. But then what? He certainly wasn't going to be any help in getting
us out. If he blundered his way down here, there was a real chance he'd misread
the delicacy of the situation and end up getting us all &quot;disappeared&quot;
by the Army. But still, I had to tell him about her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I picked up the handset again, keyed in the U.S. country
code, and tried the number for his place in Soho. He'd said he was going to be
released from St. Vincent's today, so maybe he was home by now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The familiar ring jangled half a dozen times and then . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Crenshaw residence.&quot; It was the Irish tones of
Mrs. Reilly, Sarah's day nurse. Hallelujah. I guessed she was there now taking
care of Lou.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Uh, this is Morgan James. Mr. Crenshaw's niece.
Remember? I came by. Is he home yet? I need to talk to him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's resting, dear. I was just about to go out and get
some things, milk and soup and the like.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So . . . dare I ask? How is he?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's weak, but I think he's going to be fine. If people
will just let him be.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, I hate to bother him, but it's really an
emergency. I'm calling from Guatemala.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh. I truly don't know if he's awake, dear. He was nap­ping
a while ago.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Could you . . . could you go and see? Please. And take
the phone?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just a minute.&quot; She sounded reluctant, but I could
hear her movements as she shuffled across the loft. I listened, wondering how
long Alex Goddard was going to be away, and then a moment later . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Yeah.&quot; There was a rustle as Lou got a
grip on his cord­less. &quot;Morgan, is that you? Where the hell are you
now?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It took me a second to even find my voice, I was so thrilled
to hear him. He sounded just like always.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, how's it going, champ?&quot; I said. Come on, Lou.
Get well. Fight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I started having these migraines, but they gave me some
medicine—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Listen.&quot; I cut him off, and immediately felt
guilty I'd been so impatient. &quot;I'm up in northern Guatemala and I've found
Sarah.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, my God.&quot; That was followed by a long silence,
prob­ably an emotional meltdown. &quot;Is she all right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What was I going to say? That she'd been brainwashed or worse
by Alex Goddard? That we were both in his clutches, cut off from the world, and
in deep, deep trouble?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She's able to stand,&quot; I said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I don't remember what white lies I eventually managed to tell
him. I think it was something like, &quot;She's being treated for a post-coma
syndrome by a medical specialist. I've found out that when she was in Guatemala
before, she was given some very bad drugs, and someone here who knows about
them is trying to reverse some of the damage.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alex Goddard, right?&quot; There was no BS-ing Lou for
very long. &quot;That bastard.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Lou, I'm going to get her out of here and back home as
soon as possible. Everything's going to be all right. Don't worry. It's really
too complicated to try and explain over the phone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah, well, I'm coming. Soon as I'm up. I'm gonna take
that son of a bitch by the—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't. Don't you go anywhere. I'm handling it,
okay?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>I heard him
grunt, whether from pain or frustration I couldn't be sure. &quot;Lou, listen,
I'm going to try and phone you every day. If I miss a day, then you should call
the embassy down here. Tell them you're FBI. That might get their attention.
The place where I am, where Sarah is, is named Baalum. It's a . . . kind of village.
In the northern Peten Department. I don't know if the U.S. has any clout up
here, but that's where they should come looking.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I got him to write it down, and then eased him off the line
as gently as I could and hung up. I would have loved for him to be here, but I
wanted to try to get Sarah out by stealth if I could. And stealth was scarcely
Lou's style.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My calls were one for two, and there still wasn't anybody to
help me. The time had come to try David. I was having the glimmerings of a new
strategy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was lunchtime in New York, but on Wednesdays he usu­ally
just had a sandwich at his desk. Maybe I could catch him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hello,&quot; declared the British female voice he'd put
on his machine, hoping it would sound like he had a classy secre­tary.
&quot;You've reached the office of David Roth, president of Applecore
Productions. We're sorry Mr. Roth is not available at this time to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;David,&quot; I barked into the phone. &quot;If you're
there, pick up. This is Morgan. I've got to talk to you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While the announcement kept running, noises erupted out­side
in the hall, voices and a clicking sound, as though some­thing was being rolled
along the tile floor. Shit. Was Alex Goddard about to walk in? My mouth went
dry. Come on, David, I know you're there, hiding—Variety with a tuna salad on
rye, extra pickle. Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray soda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;David damnit, pick up.&quot; I said it quieter this
time, but I could feel my heart pounding. &quot;This is an emergency.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgy, don't!&quot; He yelled as I heard the receiver
being</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>lifted.
&quot;Jesus, I just walked in from the deli. Listen, thank God it's you. Drop
whatever the hell you're not doing and get your butt in here. Jerry Reiner
called, you know, the Orion distribution deal—and he wants a rough cut of <i>Baby
Love</i> yesterday so he can pitch it to the suits on the fifth floor. We could
be staring at financial success here. I hope you can handle the vulgarity of
that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;David, you're not going to believe where I am,&quot; I
began, working out my game plan as I went along, trying to sound cool and
control my racing pulse. &quot;I'm in northern Guate­mala, at a place that
would make a terrific feature. It's like a Maya theme park, deep in the rain
forest. But it's real. I want you to contact the embassy and get them to grease
the way for my crew to come here. This is too good to pass up.&quot; I thought
about the costs and then added, &quot;At least one cam­era and sound.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>One sure way to get Sarah out was to blow the place open to
the world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's . . . where are you again?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I gave him a glowing trailer of the Williamsburg-like
qualities of Baalum—a beautiful, exciting recreation of times gone by that
out-Disneyed Disney. The cable channels would be bidding for the footage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, look, all things in time.&quot; He wasn't buying.
&quot;I'm talking an actual deal here. You know, money? Fuck the jun­gle
wonderland. You've got exactly one more day down there on the Tarzan set, or
wherever the hell it is, and then I'm gonna start finishing final cut on this
damned picture myself. Don't make me have to do that, Morgy. This is not a
drill. Nicky Russo came by again yesterday. He's fully prepared to call our
note and impound your original negative. It's here, under lock and key, but
we've got to get this project in the can and sold.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You touch a frame of my movie and I won't be
responsible for my actions.&quot; God, he was missing my SOS. &quot;David do
one thing for me, please. I can't tell you how important it is. I haven't
explained everything. This situation is . . . It's very threatening. I need you
to at least call the embassy down here and see if they'll send somebody. The
Army's all over the place and—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A loud noise intervened followed by complete, absolute
silence. The diodes on the panel all began flashing yellow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shit!&quot; Had Alex Goddard been listening in and
decided to cut me off before I could get word to the embassy?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I slammed the box and went for the usual maneuver: I cut the
connection and tried again, but nothing. Again, and still nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My hands were trembling. I'd just lost contact with the
outside world. I was completely isolated in the middle of nowhere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How convenient. Alex Goddard let me tell a couple of people I
was physically okay, and then he blocked the line.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I exhaled settled into the padded chair next to the com­puters,
and tried to think. David, David why wouldn't you listen? He was so excited
he'd completely ignored my dis­tress signal. Nobody was going to come and help
me get out of here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I gazed around the room, wondering what to do next. Was there
another phone, a radio, a box of flares, for godsake?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when I spotted the outlines of another door— why
hadn't I noticed it sooner?—this one steel, there on the left. Alex Goddard
might walk in any second now, but I had to try to learn everything I could as
fast as I could. What was going on besides what was going on?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alert for any new sounds from outside, I quickly went over
and tried the knob.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was locked tight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Figured. Now I really wanted to know what was in there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>When I
glanced around the office, I noticed a ring of keys on the desk. Could he have
forgotten them?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>More important, would I blow everything if he caught me
snooping? In spite of his attempt at a cool veneer, he might go ballistic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I made a snap decision. Take the chance and give them a try.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My hands were so moist I had trouble holding the slippery
keys, but finally I managed to shove in the first one. It went in, but nothing
would turn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Come on. I managed to wiggle the next one in, my hand
trembling now, but again the knob wouldn't budge. Footsteps outside marched up
to the door and I stopped breathing, but then they moved on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hurry. I was rapidly losing hope when the fifth one slipped
in and the knob turned. Yes!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Taking a deep breath and working on a story in case Alex
Goddard walked in, I clicked the lock and eased the door inward just enough to
look inside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hello, what's this? The space was a fully equipped medical
research lab. The lights were off, but like the office, it was illuminated by
the glow of several CRT screens stationed above a long lab bench. There also
was a large machine, probably a gas chromatograph, with its own screen, flanked
by rows of test tubes. Finally, there was a large electronic microscope
complete with video screen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>One non-medical thing stood out, though: There in the mid­dle
of the workbench was a two-foot-high bronze Dancing Shiva presiding over
whatever was going on. It was breath-takingly beautiful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So . . . what was The Lord of the Dance giving his bless­ing
to? Time to try and find out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now clanking noises were filtering in from out in the hall,
along with the pounding of heavy boots, and my pulse jumped again. Was the Army
coming to drag me away?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just go in. Do it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The CRT screens were attached to black metal containers,
their doors closed, that all were connected to a power supply, doubtless to
maintain some temperature. It looked like God­dard was incubating something in
a carefully controlled en­vironment. The whole arrangement was very carefully
organized and laid out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally I noticed a row of large steel jugs, six in all, near
the back and covered with a sheet of black plastic, thin like a wrap. What
could they be? Some kind of special gas for use in the lab?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Voices in Spanish drifted in from the hallway. A woman and a
man were arguing about something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay, get out of here. Come back and check this out when
nobody's around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I stepped back into the office, clicked off the thumb latch
on the door so it wouldn't lock, and closed it. I realized I was pouring sweat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What next? Well, see if the phone's working again and try
calling the Camino Real and see if Steve's come back there for some reason,
maybe a change in plans. It would be a long shot, but still . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My hand was shaking as I opened up the phone case. Thank God,
the diodes were all quiet. Maybe . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The steel door I'd closed only moments before swung open and
Alex Goddard walked through. Did he realize I'd left it unlocked? How did he
get in there? Was there another door?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd changed clothes and was wearing a pale blue surgical
gown. I shut the phone case, as though just finishing with it. Could he tell
I'd turned myself into a nervous wreck? I tried to smile and look normal, but
my shirt was soaking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ah, I see you're finished,&quot; he said, not seeming
to notice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&quot;Good.
As I said, I've got an in-vitro procedure scheduled now for one of the couples
here in the village. You're wel­come to observe. It might help you decide what
you want to do in your own case.&quot; He was moving across the room. &quot;You
can watch on the closed circuit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He reached up and snapped on a monitor bolted to the wall in
the corner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, just one small word of forewarning.&quot; He was
turning back. &quot;Down here I've made certain . . . cosmetic changes in the
procedure to keep patients' anxiety levels as low as possible. It wouldn't be
appropriate in your case, but . . . well, you'll see.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before I had time to wonder what he meant, he disap­peared
back through the steel door with a reassuring smile.</span></p>

<h2><a name=bookmark25>Chapter Twenty-three</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='color:windowtext'>T</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>he monitor's picture was in color,
but the predominant hue was brown. Where was this? The OR had to be some­where in
the clinic, but still . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The space looked flawlessly sterile, obviously an operat­ing
theater, but it was certainly like none other on earth. The walls were not
white or pale blue; they had the shade of stone and were decorated with Maya
picture writing and bas-reliefs. It was as though a sacred chapel had been
converted into a surgery. I guessed this was what he meant by &quot;cos­metic
changes.&quot; A door was visible on the right side of the screen, and moments
later Alex Goddard strode through, coming in from the hallway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So, it must be right next door. God, the place looked an­cient
and haunted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I watched as he walked over to a basin and scrubbed his
hands, then donned a white surgical mask. Next he flipped various switches on
the walls. Finally he put on a second mask that glistened like some green
crystalline material.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What was that for? Then it hit me. A &quot;jade&quot; mask .
. .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was something Sarah had mentioned in her ramblings. So
she must have seen this too. Which meant. . . not everything she described was
just some drug-induced hallu­cination. The mask part was very real. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Marcelina was rolling a steel operating table, bearing a
dark-haired Maya woman, through the doorway. The pa­tient looked like all the
others down in Baalum, except that she had a strange expression on her face.
She appeared to be tense and very afraid, as her eyes kept darting around the
room, then to the &quot;jade&quot; mask Alex Goddard was wearing— most likely
papier-mache covered with shiny green granules.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When she was in position, he walked to the corner and flipped
another switch, whereupon there started the deep droning of a chant, probably
from speakers in the walls, that sounded like Kekchi Maya.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He bent over her and said something in the same language,
after which Marcelina placed a rubber mask over her nose and mouth. Her eyes
still frightened, the patient uttered a few words, perhaps a final prayer, then
inhaled deeply. As her eyelids fluttered, he turned and opened what appeared to
be some kind of stone tableau, covered by its own bas-relief. It was, I finally
realized, merely painted fiberglass—that was what the whole room was—and inside
were CRT monitors designed to display various vital life functions. As
Marcelina helped him, he began attaching sensors to the patient's body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When the woman's eyes had fully closed, he removed his green
mask and tossed it into a box.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It's all fake. The room, everything. Just like <i>Baalum</i>.
But now he's got Sarah's mind caught in his thrall. I've got to make her
understand nothing here is real.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Marcelina was carefully watching the screens, her
apprehension obvious as she fiddled uncertainly with the knobs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oxygen steady.&quot; Her voice was small and uneasy.
&quot;EKG stable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He immediately stripped away the sheet that had been covering
the patient. Beneath it was an open-sided gown colored in brilliant stripes of
red and blue. He pulled it back with absent precision, then turned to
Marcelina.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shave her and scrub her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With the woman now under sedation, Marcelina put on her own
surgical garb: She pulled a blue plastic cap over her hair, then secured a
white OR mask over her face. While she was finishing the preparations, he
turned and walked to the far side of the room, where he abruptly seemed to
disappear through the wall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What . . . There must be a panel there, a camouflaged door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was gone for a moment, then reappeared carrying a long
metal tube that looked to be emitting white vapor. He next opened yet another
ersatz stone cabinet to reveal a mi­croscope with a CRT screen above it. He
took out three glass ampules from the tube—frozen embryos, undoubtedly—and
placed them in a container. When he switched on the micro­scope, its CRT screen
showed him whatever he needed to know. Interesting. In surgery, he was coldly
efficient, no &quot;hu­man touch.&quot; Here he was the &quot;scientist&quot;
Alex Goddard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next, Marcelina activated an ultrasound scanner and be­gan
running the wand over the woman's stomach. The screen above the table showed
her uterus and her Fallopian tubes with flickering clarity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd been readying the embryos, and now he walked over and
carefully inserted a needle into the woman's abdomen— ouch—his eyes on the
ultrasound scan, which indicated the precise location of the needle's tip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I watched as the screen showed the needle on its way to its
destination, a thin, hard line amidst the pulsing gray mass of her uterus.
Seconds later all three embryos had been im­planted with such flawless
precision it was scary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Did I want to undergo this deeply invasive procedure at the
hands of Alex Goddard? The very thought left a dull ache in my stomach.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While Marcelina bandaged her and began preparing her for
return to wherever she'd been, he turned off the systems, then closed their
&quot;stone&quot; cabinets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I thought back to some of the &quot;hallucinations&quot;
Sarah had poured out. She'd mentioned the green mask, and she'd also relived
some sinister event that seemed to her like disappear­ing down a long white
tunnel. Was that her own anesthesia? Did he perform an in vitro on her too?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I jumped as I heard the &quot;bump, thump, bump&quot; sound
of the operating table being rolled out of the OR and back down the hall. For
some reason I thought of the sound of fate knocking on the door, like death
coming to take Don Giovanni. Did Alex Goddard have plans to take me, only with
drugs and medical sleight of hand? It wasn't going to happen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I switched off the monitor and turned to stare at the
computers. Why were they here in this &quot;place of miracles&quot;? What did
they hold? Maybe that was where I should be. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was the moment when the heavy office door swung open and
Marcelina appeared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your room is ready now.&quot; Her English was heavily
ac­cented but sure. &quot;He sent me to show you. And I can wash any of your
things if you like.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My room? Whoa! Since when had I checked in?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Marcelina, we need to talk. What happened to Sarah the
last time she was here? Was she operated on like that woman just now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I also planned to ask her about all the bizarre trappings
surrounding the procedure. Why was the woman so sucked in by his phony Mardi
Gras mysticism? Had Sarah fallen for it too?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sara was one of the special ones. You are surely
blessed too. You resemble her a lot.&quot; She looked at me, affection in her
dark eyes, then turned and headed out the door. &quot;But come, let me take you
up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Of course I resembled her; she was my cousin. But so what? I
didn't like the odd way she'd said it. And what about my question?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Watching her walk away, clearly nervous, I realized this was
the moment I'd been dreading—when I had to make a decision about how far to
play along with Alex Goddard. Steve couldn't be reached, yet, but I still might
be able to handle the situation on my own. The first thing to do was to get
down to Sarah and talk some sense into her. Then I had to arrange for a way to
get us both out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So . . . probably the best way to accomplish that was to go
along with my own medical charade for a few more hours, to give me time to
scout the scene and come up with a plan. A room would be a base to operate
from.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Still, I was feeling plenty of trepidation as we ascended the
marble steps to the second floor, which had a long, car­peted hallway with
doors along each side. Then, when we started down the hall, I caught the sound
of a baby crying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's this floor for?&quot; I remembered Alex Goddard
had claimed it was to provide a postpartum bonding period, but I wanted to
confirm that with my own eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is the recovery ward and nursery. Here, let me
show you.&quot; She paused and pushed open the door nearest us. I looked in to
see a Mayan woman resting on a high hospital bed and wearing a white shift,
with an ornate wicker cradle, wide and deep, next to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Marcelina smiled and said something to her that sounded like
an apology for the intrusion. The room was lit only by candles, but I did make
out how oddly the woman stared at me, as though she was seeing a spirit. Why
was that? Because I was a <i>gringa </i>here in the middle of the forest? But
it seemed something more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The birth of a child is a sacred thing for us.&quot;
Marcelina was discreetly closing the door again. &quot;When a woman car­ries a
child she will take walks to the <i>milpas</i>, to the river, to the orchards,
just so her little one can be in its world. Then, after her baby is born, our
tradition holds that she should be alone with it for a week and a day. So their
life's breath can become one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I could sense her heart was deeply entwined with the peo­ple
here at Baalum.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Marcelina, how long have—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, what do you think?&quot; said a voice. I looked
around to see Alex Goddard coming up the stairs behind us. And my anger welled
up again. Everything about him was just too . . . manipulating.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd changed back to his black sweatshirt and jeans and was
carrying a tray. The costume event was over. In an instant Marcelina slipped
quietly around him and headed back down the stairs, almost like a rabbit
startled by a fox. He smiled and moved past me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All those trappings just now, the fake green
mask.&quot; I decided to challenge him head-on. Start forcing him to show his
hand. &quot;What's—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Merely a little harmless theater.&quot; He looked back.
&quot;The forest Maya like to think they're being ministered to by a
shaman.&quot; Then he indicated I should follow him. &quot;By the way, in case
you do get hungry, I brought you something you can have in your room if you
like. Then you can make yourself at home and rest a bit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hold on. I was being given the illusion of freedom, but in
reality I was nothing more than his prisoner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;That room next to your office. The steel door.
What's in—?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the heart of <i>Baalum</i>.&quot; Pride in his
voice. &quot;The real reason I'm here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean drug research?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He nodded. &quot;Did you know the Central American rain
forest easily contains a hundred thousand plant species? Over half of all
pharmaceutical drugs are derived from plants, yet less than one percent of
those here have been tested for phar­macological potential. Still, the old
shamans and midwives all know of herbs they claim can cure everything from men­strual
cramps to cancer.&quot; He smiled. &quot;They also know which ones have
powerful contraceptive properties, which is par­ticularly helpful in my primary
study, fertility and fetal vi­ability. I take the specimens they bring and
perform a rough screening in the lab to determine if they're actually pharma­cologically
active. If they do test positive, I then examine their effect on the
blastocyst, the early form of embryonic cell formed just after fertilization,
to see whether they affect cell division and viability and . . . the
miscarriage rate here is very low, so some of these plants . . .&quot; His
voice trailed off as he pushed open the door of a suite at the end of the hall.
It had a stone floor, a simple bed, and through the slatted windows the light
of midday filtered through, along with the birdcalls of the rain forest. Any
other time and place, I'd have felt like I was staying at a rustic nature
retreat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But this wasn't some other time and place. And what about
Steve? Where was he? Maybe he was somewhere worse. Thinking about him, I was
startled to hear myself say . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Incidentally, I found out the man I've been trying to
have a baby with didn't show up at his hotel in Belize last night. He was
driving there from Guatemala City. I'm very worried. I keep hearing about how
people get 'disappeared' in this country. He's—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Could his name be Steve Abrams?&quot; Goddard turned
back, still holding the tray.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was a moment that stopped my heart. For a second I wasn't
even able to speak.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How . . . did you know?&quot; I finally managed to say.
&quot;I never mentioned—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the name they gave me. I received a call this
morn­ing from Guatemala City. From Colonel Ramos's office, in fact. As you
might suppose, he's well aware you're here, and he said you were seen dining
night before last at a downtown restaurant with a man by that name. They think
he's in the country because of you, and they're trying to locate him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I felt the life go entirely out of me. My God what was going
on? Steve was now the subject of a manhunt in a police state. Did he even know?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I told them you were here for purely medical
reasons.&quot; He sighed with frustration. &quot;And that they were being irra­tionally
paranoid but . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So they don't actually know where he is, right?&quot; I
was still trying to breathe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As of this morning. If they did they wouldn't have
called up here.&quot; He walked over and set the tray down on a rustic table
next to the bed. &quot;I wouldn't worry too much about it. He's committed no
crime. They just want to make sure you realize your presence has not gone
unnoticed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dear God. What had I dragged Steve into? If they found him,
what would they do? I could only pray he was deft enough to elude them. If
anybody could . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I looked at the tray. An empty syringe was there. Also,
there was a large bowl containing some kind of soup. I was finally growing
ravenous, but still . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's this for?&quot; I indicated the syringe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I just need to take a little blood for some tests.
Don't worry, it won't hurt a bit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hold on. How far do I have to play along to stay in his chess
game?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I glanced down again at the tray. &quot;And what's in
that bowl?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right now diet is crucial, so I've had Marcelina
prepare you a healthy broth of soy extract and buckwheat and rainforest herbs
that—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What kind of rainforest herbs exactly?&quot; I was
starving, but no way in hell—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Medicinal ones. Part of your program of
wholeness.&quot; He turned, with that faraway look of his, and opened the
window slats. Beyond them I could see foliage, now alive with flocks of
multicolored birds. The forest was in full cry. &quot;You know, so many drugs
are waiting to be discovered up here.&quot; He was gazing out. &quot;Beyond
this window is a giant pharmacy, but if it goes like the rest of the Peten,
it'll soon be bulldozed to make way for more cattle ranches.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He came back and picked up the syringe. That was when I
noticed it didn't seem to be entirely empty. It appeared to contain traces of a
yellow substance, though maybe I was imagining. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, about the blood test. I don't think—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Consider it a free medical screening.&quot; He firmly
gripped my arm as he plunged the needle into a vein. Seconds later he was
capping off the syringe, red with my blood. &quot;I'm running a batch of tests
this afternoon, so one more sample won't make any difference.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While he swabbed my arm with alcohol, I looked down again at
the bowl of broth he'd brought. Forget about it. I'd find something in the
kitchen later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I want to go down and see Sarah.&quot; Get started
immedi­ately. Push and maybe I could catch him off guard. &quot;I'm very
worried about her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course.&quot; He nodded. &quot;Whenever you
wish.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was thinking, as soon as possible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I'll send Marcelina to take you, the minute she's
finished downstairs. But I assumed you might want to at least unpack
first.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With that he disappeared as quietly as he'd come.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I walked over and stared out at the birds flitting past the
slatted window, feeling my hopes go up. The colors and the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>freedom. I
wanted to be one of them, to take Sarah and just fly away. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then, feeling vaguely drowsy, I settled myself down on the
edge of the bed. The next thing I knew, though, the cha­otic music of the birds
had begun to sound amplified as though they were swirling down a long, echoing
hallway. In spite of myself, I felt my consciousness begin to drift.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shit, that needle he just slammed into my arm. It wasn't to
take blood you idiot. You suspected that, but he was too fast. Shit. Shit.
Shit. Don't let him do it. Stay awake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But now the tunnel was growing. I pulled myself up and
staggered in slow motion to the door and tried it, but it seemed to be locked.
I couldn't really tell, though, because the tunnel was swallowing me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No! I banged my head against the door, hoping the pain would
bring me back, but the room just swirled even more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The tunnel. Now it was all around me, shadowy and dim. I
thought I glimpsed Sarah at the end of it, wearing a white shift, beckoning me,
but when I reached out for her, to take us away, all I could touch was empty
mist.</span></p>

<h2><a name=bookmark26>                               Chapter Twenty-four</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='color:windowtext'>I</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'m on a bed, in a dreamscape room
enveloped in pastel fog, watching a Melania butterfly the size of a man pump
his massive orange and black wings above me. His voice is mellifluous,
hypnotic, and I feel the soft wind of his wings against my face, cooling,
scented, enveloping. It is the soft­ness of eternal peace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your body is a realm of fertility,&quot; he is saying,
his tones echoing in the shadowy haze around me, sonorous and car­ing.
&quot;You are special.&quot; Then, iridescent blues and purples shimmering off
his wings, his face evolves into the orange and black mask of a jaguar.
&quot;You are one of the special ones. Together we will create life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Did he say &quot;special&quot;? Marcelina said I was . . .
like Sarah . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now his eyes are boring in and I'm thinking of the Chi­nese .
. . Am I human, dreaming I'm a butterfly, or am I a butterfly dreaming I'm
human?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he moves over me, the rest of his butterfly form dis­appears
and he's become a lithe jaguar whose lips are touch­ing mine. The sheet over me
melts into my skin as the soft spotted fur of his underbelly presses onto me.
And his face has turned even more feline and sensuous, with dark eyes that look
directly through me. I can feel his whiskers against me as he sniffs down my
body,  then explores my groin with his probing tongue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before I realize what's happening, his thighs press against
mine and he knowingly insinuates himself into me. It all happens so naturally
and effortlessly I scarcely . . . I see only an intense twitch of his animal
ears, erect and directed toward me, as he enfolds me completely, his hot male
breath urgent. As he grinds his thighs against mine, he emits growls, low in
his throat, then nips lightly and lovingly at my cheek, his pale fangs benign
and delicious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I cling to him, bathed in sweat, falling into him, wanting
him, but now . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He's changing. . . . My God. No! He's . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His face is becoming a jade mask with eyes that burn a fiery
red, a spirit of evil. He's plunging something deep into me, metal, cold and
cutting. Far inside, reaching, while my mind fights through the waves of pain
that course down my lower body. I struggle back, but my arms just pass through
empty air. Stop. The eyes, the hard metal . . . Time turns fluid, minutes are
hours, lost, and I don't know . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally-—it could be years later—he growls one last time and
the room begins fading to darkness. Then a blessed numbness washes over me.
He's gone. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And I dream I am dead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sometime, probably hours later, I sensed my conscious­ness
gradually returning. Around me the room was still dark and, remembering the
&quot;dream,&quot; I came fully awake with a start, my heart pounding. What had
. . . it done to me? I was shivering, with a piercing, pointed ache in my
groin. I needed air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I rose up unsteadily and reached out, and realized I was in a
hospital bed with metal bars along one side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What! How did I come to be in this? Then I began remembering.
I was at <i>Baalum</i>, in Alex Goddard's Ninos del Mundo clinic. And I'd been
trying to get Sarah and take her home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Instead, I'd passed out and then . . . an attack, some
unspeakably evil . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Get out of here. Now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I settled my feet onto the floor with a surge of determi­nation,
and that was when I sensed I was in a different place from where I'd . . .
Where—!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I gazed around in the dark, then reached out and felt
something on a table beside the bed. It was a clay bowl full of wax. What . . .
a candle. And next to it I touched a plain book of matches. My hand was
trembling from the pain in my groin, but I managed to light the candle, a
flickering glow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My wristwatch was lying nearby on the table. Someone must
have taken it off and placed it there. I picked it up and held it by the
candle, and for a moment I was confused by the seconds ticking off. Then I
realized the time was . . . How could that be! It read 4:57 A.M. Had I been out
for hours?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I gasped, then raised the candle and gazed around. The walls
were brown stone—or maybe they just looked like stone. Yes, now I recognized
it. I was in the fiberglass-walled operating room I'd seen on Alex Goddard's
closed-circuit monitor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What was I doing in here?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My arm brushed against the table and I felt an odd sen­sation.
Glancing down, I realized there was a Band-Aid on the inside of my left wrist.
What was that about? Earlier he'd taken blood from my right arm, but then he'd
just swabbed it, so why this bandage? And what in hell was I doing in an
operating room? I hadn't agreed to any procedures. Did he come back for a
second—?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Or . . . that was what he'd done. He'd injected me with an IV
drug. The bizarre vision I'd had was his cover for some perverse invasion of my
body. My God, I'd been unconscious since yesterday afternoon. During all that
time, what could he have done to me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was fist-clenching furious. Looking around the &quot;oper­ating
room,&quot; I wanted to rip the place apart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I tried to stand, I realized my groin was tender and
sore as hell, all across my panty-line, only somewhere deep, deep inside, in my
reproductive . . . It was like after he'd given me those shots up at Quetzal
Manor. I checked and saw no red needle-punctures this time, but the pain was
much worse. That sick butterfly-jaguar dream was no dream. I'd been raped by .
. . The bastard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I pushed aside the pain, edged across to the door, and tested
it. Unlocked. Good. Go find the SOB right now. Tear his head off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I pulled back the door, took a deep breath, and checked out
the hallway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whoa! How did they get here? In the dim light I made out two
uniformed Army privates down at the end near the slatted windows, dozing in
folding metal chairs, their AK- 47's propped against the plaster wall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why were they here? Just a cool, breezy place to hang out? Or
were they in place to guard me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The breeze was causing the candle's flame to cast flick­ering
shadows across the hall, so I quickly re-closed the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now what? I was trembling as I returned the candle bowl to
the table and sat down on the bed. Soldiers with guns were outside my room at five
in the morning. In the farthest end of Guatemala. What was I going to do?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I gazed around at the &quot;stone&quot; walls and tried to
think. My mind still felt clouded from whatever drug he'd given me, but it was
beginning to . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Wait. I saw Alex Goddard come into this very room with
embryos from the lab, which is connected by the steel door to his office. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Where there was a phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Time to call the embassy, get some help to get the hell out
of here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I sat there thinking. All right. I'd need to wait an hour or
so—now I'd get some low-level flunkie stuck with the grave­yard shift—but there
was something I was damned well go­ing to do immediately. With the lab right
next door, I could try to find out why Goddard had just performed medical rape
on me. There had to be some connection. According to him, the lab was for
&quot;plant research.&quot; But if that was all he was doing, why was the Army
here? Right outside my door? I felt a pump of adrenaline that made me forget
all about my pain. Before I got the hell out of <i>Baalum</i>, I was going to
know what he was really up to here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>God, I feel miserable. I really hurt. All the more
reason . . .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I took the candle, stood up, and moved to the opposite wall
to begin looking for an opening in the fiberglass &quot;stone.&quot; It
appeared to have been made from impressions from the room atop the pyramid,
rows and rows of those little cartoon-face glyphs, mixed in with bas-reliefs,
but there had to be a door somewhere. I'd seen him walk right through it. As I
ran my hand along the surface, I was struck by how their hardness felt like
stone. But it couldn't be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What was I looking for? There certainly were no door­knobs. I
came across a hard crack, next to the bas-relief of a feather-festooned
warrior, but as I slid my hand down, it ended and again there was more rough
&quot;stone.&quot; Solid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Damn. I stood back and studied the wall with my candle. He'd
come in from the left, which would be about . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I moved over and started again. This time my fingernail
caught in a crevice that ran directly down to the floor. Then I discovered
another, about two and a half feet farther along. It had to be the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I felt along the side, wondering how to open it, till I
noticed that one of the little &quot;stone&quot; glyphs gave way when I pressed
it. When I put my hand against it harder and rotated it, the panel clicked
backward, then swung inward. Yes!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And there it was: the lab, CRT screens above the incuba­tors,
gas chromatograph in the corner. This, according to him, was where he tested
the rainforest plants the shamans and midwives brought in. But what about what
he'd just done to <i>me</i>?</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I was still worried about the Army guys outside, but
I walked in, trying to be as quiet as I could. The first thing I did was head
for the row of black boxes above the bench. Those, I assumed, were being used
to maintain a micro-en­vironment for incubating plant specimens. And sure
enough, the dimly lit windows revealed rows and rows of petri dishes. They were
clear, with circular indentations in the center. . . .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But wait a minute. Those weren't just any old lab dishes. And
no plant extracts were in them either, just clear liquid. That was odd, very
fishy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I stood there puzzling, and then I remembered seeing pic­tures
of lab dishes like these being used for artificially fer­tilized embryos. At
the beginning, freshly extracted human ova are placed in an incubator for
several hours, afloat in a medium that replicates the inside of a female
Fallopian tube, to mature them in preparation for fertilization. Goddard had
said something about tests on the blastocyst, the first cellular material
created after fertilization. So was he using actual fetuses? My God. I felt
like I was starting to know, or guess, a lot more than he wanted me to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My thoughts were churning as I looked up and studied the
video screens above the boxes. It took a moment, but then I figured out the
petri dishes and their chemicals had been placed in the incubators between 4:00
P.M. and 7:30 P.M. Last evening. What—?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I started counting. They were in racks, stacked, in sets of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>four by
four. Let's see. Five in this incubator, five in the next, five in the . . .
There were over two hundred dishes in all!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Impossible. I looked down at them again, feeling a chill.
Nothing seemed to be in them yet, at least as far as I could tell, but then
human eggs are microscopic. So if ova were . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When he supposedly was doing that <i>in vitro </i>on the
Mayan woman, was he actually extracting eggs?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Get serious. That was not where they came from.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By then I was well along the Kubler-Ross scale, past de­nial
and closing in on anger, but still . . . so many! How could they all—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I turned and examined the row of plastic-covered jugs at the
back of the lab, lined up, six in all. Now I had to know what was in them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was still shaky, but I steadied myself, walked over, pulled
back the plastic, and touched one. It was deathly cold, sweat­ing in the moist
air. When I flipped open its Frisbee-sized top, I saw a faint wisp of vapor
emerge into the twilight of the room . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then it dawned on me. Of course. They were cryo-storage containers.
He'd need them to preserve fertilized eggs, em­bryos.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I lifted off the inside cover and placed it carefully onto
the bench, where it immediately turned white, steaming with mist. Then I
noticed a tiny metal rod hooked over the side of the opening. When I pulled it
up, it turned out to be at­tached to a porous metal cylinder containing rows of
glass tubes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What's . . .?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Feeling like I was deep in a medical fourth dimension, I took
out one of the freezing tubes. It was notched and marked with a code labeled
along the side: &quot;BL -1 la,&quot; &quot;BL -1 lb,&quot; &quot;BL-1
lc,&quot; and so it went, all the way to &quot;g.&quot; But noth­ing was there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I began checking the other tubes. They all were empty too. So
why was he freezing empty containers?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Go with the simple answer. He's getting them ready for new
embryos.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I slid the rod back into the cryo-tank, then walked over and
hoisted myself onto the lab bench next to the Dancing Shiva, creator and
destroyer. And when I did, I again felt a stab of pain in my groin. The
bastard. I was shaking, in the early stages of shock. More than anything, I
just wanted to find him and kill him. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I thought I heard a scraping noise somewhere outside, in the
hall, and I froze. Was he about to come in and check on his
&quot;experiments&quot;? Then I realized it was just the building, his house of
horrors, creaking from the wind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I took one final look at the incubators, and all the pain
came back. The whole thing was too much for my body to take in. I sat there
trying to muster my strength.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Don't stop now. Keep going.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I got back onto my feet. The phone. Use the telephone. Find
Steve, alert the embassy, then get Sarah. Do it now, while you still can.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was holding my breath as I walked over and pushed open the
door to the office and looked in. It was empty and dark. Good. I headed
straight for the black case of the Magellan World Phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I picked up the handset and switched it on, the diodes
went through their techno-dance of greens and yel­lows and then stabilized
giving me a dial tone. Thank you, merciful God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I decided to start off by calling the hotel in Belize again,
on the long shot that Steve had managed to get the hell out of Guatemala. Baby,
please be there. My watch said the time was five-twenty in the morning, but he
once told me they manned the desk around the clock. No problem getting through,
though the connection had a lot of static. But then came the news I'd been
dreading: no Steve Abrams.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He still not come back, mon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Where was he? I wanted to scream, but I was determined to
keep a grip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All right, try the Camino Real and hope you can get some­body
awake who speaks English. Maybe he went back. Please, God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I had the number memorized, so I plugged it in, and I
recognized the voice of the guy who picked up, the owner's son, who was trying
his best to learn English.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi, this is Morgan James. Remember me? I'm just call­ing
to see if there's a Steve Abrams staying there now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, <i>que pasa</i>, Senora James. Very early, yes? <i>Momento</i>.&quot;
There was a pause as he checked. Come on, Steve, be there. Please, please be
somewhere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the voice came back: &quot;No, nobody by that name stays
here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay . . . <i>gracias</i>.&quot; Shit. It was like a
pit had opened somewhere deep in my stomach.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I replaced the handset, feeling grateful that at least the
phone still worked, my last link to sanity. My next call was going to be to the
embassy, but I couldn't risk using up my opening shot with the graveyard shift.
Maybe by 6 A.M. some­body with authority to do something would be there. Just a
few more minutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now what? I felt the aching soreness in my groin again, along
with a wave of nausea. I had to do something, anything, just to keep going, to
beat back an anxiety attack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when I turned and stared at the computers, the
little ducks drifting across the screens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All right, you know what he's doing; now it's time to try and
find out why. The real why. There must be records of what he's up to stored
there. What else would he have them for?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Clang, clang, clang.&quot; A noise erupted from
somewhere outside the window. In spite of myself, I jumped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I realized it was just the odd call of some forest bird.
God, I wasn't cut out for this. Now my head was hurting, stabs of pain, but I
rubbed at my temples and sat down at the first terminal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'm a Mac fan, hate Windows, so I had to start out by
experimenting. In the movies people always know how to do this, but I had to go
with trial and error, error compounding error.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After endless false starts that elicited utility screens I
couldn't get rid of, I finally brought up an index of files, which included a
long list of names.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>ALKALOIDS </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>CARDIAC
GLYCOSIDES </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>PHENOLICS </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>SAPONINS </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>TERPENOIDS</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Biology 103—which I hated—was coming back. Plant-extract
categories. Looks like he actually is doing research on the flora here. But . .
. still, what does he need my ova for?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I scrolled on. Scientific terms that meant nothing. Then,
toward the end of the alphabetical list, I came to the word QUETZAL.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What was that? I clicked on it and—lo and behold—up came a
short list of names. Six in all, organized by dates about a year apart, and
each a woman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God. First I assumed they were patients from Quetzal Manor
who'd come here for fertility treatment, though each was indicated
&quot;terminated&quot; at the end, whatever that meant. But as I scanned down,
I didn't want to see what I was seeing. The name next to the last was S.
Crenshaw. She'd been &quot;ter­minated&quot; too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The bottom was M. James. But I hadn't been &quot;termi­nated.&quot;
Not yet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I slumped back in the chair, trying to breathe. How much more
of this horror could I handle? Finally I leaned forward again and with a
trembling hand clicked on S. Crenshaw.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A lot of data popped up, including three important dates. The
first was exactly three weeks after the one in her pass­port, the Guatemalan
entry visa. The second was ten months ago, the third eight months ago. After
each was a number: 268, followed by 153, and finally 31.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The count of her extracted ova. Kill him. Just kill him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A lot of medical terminology I couldn't interpret followed
each number, but the note at the end required no degree.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Blastocyst material from embryos after third extraction
shows 84% decrease in cellular viability. No longer usable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God, had he made her permanently sterile?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While that obscenity was sinking in, I went back and clicked
on my own name. The date was today, the number was 233. He'd just taken 233 of
my ova. I stared at the screen and felt faint.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No medical analysis had yet been entered, but it didn't
matter. I stared at the screen, feeling numb, for a full minute before clicking
back to Sarah's page. Yes, I was right. The last date was just six weeks before
she was found in a coma, down the river from here. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No more mystery. He'd been using her eggs to create embryos,
and they'd finally stopped working. Not &quot;special&quot; anymore. So her
&quot;program&quot; had been &quot;terminated.&quot; In the river.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My stomach was churning, bile in my throat, and I thought</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>I was going
to throw up. I took a deep breath, slowly, and stopped myself. Before I got
Sarah and we got the hell out of <i>Baalum</i>, I was going to smash everything
in this lab.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It all had just come together. Those shots of &quot;muscle re­laxant&quot;
he gave me up at Quetzal Manor, they had to be a cocktail of his
&quot;proprietary&quot; ovulation drugs. Then, with my ovaries ripening, he'd
lured me here using Sarah. He knew I'd come after her. Next he'd
&quot;arranged&quot; with Alan Dupre to fly me here. Finally, a sedative, and
he'd harvested 233 of my ova, which he now had out there in those incubators. .
. .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But what about proof? To show the world. Morning sounds were
building up outside, so I was less worried whether the two soldiers in the
hallway were still asleep or not. Truthfully, I was so wired I no longer cared.
I clicked on a printer and began zipping off the files of each woman he'd
violated, all six.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Disgust flowed through me like a torrent. Heart of Dark­ness.
&quot;The horror, the horror.&quot; Alex Goddard had used Sarah in the most
unspeakable way possible, then tried to have her murdered. Probably he'd just
turned her over to Colonel Ra­mos.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The same thing must have happened to those other women. All
&quot;disappeared&quot; somewhere in Guatemala. But who would know?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>One thing I knew. I was next. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The printer was old and loud, but thankfully it was fast.
Four minutes later I had what I'd need to nail the criminal. When I got out of
here, somebody would have to believe me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While I was stacking the printouts, I resolved to call the
embassy right then, the hour be damned. I was sweating like a gazelle when the
lion is closing in. Alex Goddard had just performed primal, surgical rape on
me, and now the Army was right outside. I had to get the embassy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And that was when I realized I didn't have the number. But it
had to be in a phone book somewhere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A quick look around the office didn't turn up one. I con­sidered
ringing the Camino Real again, to ask them to look up the number, but then I
had an inspired thought. Steve had said Alan Dupre's number was easy to
remember because it promoted his business. What was it? I couldn't remember.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then it came back: 4-MAYAN, the six-digit number they used in
Guatemala City. Call the sleazebag and ask him who can get me out of here. He's
supposed to know everybody.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dawn was bringing more and more forest-morning songs through
the thin slats of the windows. I walked over and pushed them open, running my
fingers out into the air. It felt cool, the touch of freedom, and I thought for
a moment about bursting through to escape. Just get Sarah now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Instead, I walked back to the phone, clenching my fists, and
dialed Alan Dupre's number, praying and hoping it was where he lived. Steve had
called him late in the evening, so it probably was. I'd thought I never wanted
to speak to him again, but now . . . God, let him be there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The phone, however, just rang and rang and rang.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Come on. Damn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It rang and rang some more. Then finally—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who the fuck is this? We don't open till nine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The first sound of his voice brought a wave of relief, but
then his cocky attitude made me livid all over again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's Morgan James, you shit. Why did you leave me
stranded up here? You have no idea what—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, you . . .&quot; He paused for a cigarette cough.
&quot;You made me walk all the way downstairs just to bust my chops. What
the—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Talk to me, you prick.&quot; I still intended to
strangle him. &quot;I need your help. You owe me. You have no idea what—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, lady, you didn't possibly believe taking off in
that fucking hurricane was my . . . Let's just say I was acting under duress. I
all but didn't get back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, you can start making up for that right now by
springing me the hell out of here.&quot; So, somebody had put him up to it,
just like I'd thought all along. But who? &quot;I want you to look up the
number for the American embassy. And tell me the name of somebody there
who—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jesus, you truly don't get the picture, do you?&quot;
He paused for another early-morning reefer hack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I 'get' that you—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Missy, it was a high official at that very
establishment 'suggested' I fly you up there. Why the hell else would I do it,
for chrissake? You know I'm not a citizen of this fun house. Said party noted
that if I didn't, he could make a few phone calls about my residency status, my
pilot's license . . . Let's just say it was an offer I didn't see fit to take
issue with.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, my God.&quot; I felt like a knife had just plunged
into my back. &quot;Was his name Barry Morton? Please tell me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Taking the Fifth on that one,&quot; he said coughing
again. &quot;But you've got primal instincts.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I heard a noise outside and sank lower in the chair. What was
I going to do now?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Listen, do you have any idea where Steve is? They're
looking—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No shit, Madame Sherlock. I had a long, deeply unin­spiring
interrogation by a couple of upscale assholes who showed up here in an Army
Jeep. They wanted to know where the fuck he was, when I'd supped with him last.
Let me inform you, love, you got my old heartstrings buddy in some decided
doo-doo.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I feel guilty enough about that as is, so stop.&quot;
In spite of all Alex Goddard had done, I felt horrible about Steve, like a
self-involved witch. &quot;But do you know where he is now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Haven't the foggiest fucking idea, never heard of the
jerk. Shit, hang on.&quot; The line went silent, and I could feel my pulse
pounding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Outside the office door, I heard footsteps approaching down
the hall. Please, God, please. But then they passed by, terminating where the
two soldiers had been dozing. Next I heard the tones of a solid dressing-down
in profane Spanish.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Tu heres un pedaso de mierda!&quot;</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Then came a familiar voice from the receiver. I
couldn't believe it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgy, why in hell did you let Alan take you up there
by yourself?&quot; His tone had a sadness, and a deserved pique, that cut me to
the core.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I think I stopped breathing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, baby, thank God you're . . .&quot; I was expecting
the door to burst open any moment. Men with AK-47's. &quot;Do you know the
Army's looking for—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're completely nuts. I got halfway to Belize and
called the motel to see how you were doing, and they told me you'd taken off
with this asshole. So I turned around and drove back here. It was after
midnight and the Army thugs had just left. Morgy, I'm coming to get you. Soon
as the gas stations open. I know a back road to Mexico. We've got to get out of
this fucking country immediately.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't try to drive up. It's too dangerous. Can you get
Alan to fly you? Sarah's here and she's been turned into a space cadet. I don't
know how I'm going to pry her away.&quot; I stopped to try to assemble my
thoughts. &quot;He's got soldiers watching me. I've got to smuggle her out
somehow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I couldn't bring myself to tell him what was really going on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me talk to Dupre a second. The fucker. I can't
believe he did this to you. But maybe we can come up with some­thing.
Otherwise, I may just kill him with my bare hands.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I heard a cough, which told me Alan had been listening in on
an extension. It teed me off, but then—he did have to be in on this. Shit. The idea
of relying on Alan Dupre for anything . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, do it fast. I broke into Alex Goddard's office to
use this phone and . . . just hurry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You got it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now the sound of firm, officer-like boot steps stormed past
the door, headed out this time, after which the two young soldiers began
berating each other in high-pitched Spanish.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Hace falta tener cojones!</i>&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;<i>Hijo de tu chingada madre!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>More and more light was creeping through the slatted
windows. A glance at my watch showed the time to be six sharp, but the embassy
was no longer an option.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Listen,&quot; Steve said coming back on, &quot;there's
some rain due for tonight, but he says he thinks we can try. He claims there's
a clearing about a quarter of a mile down a gravel road that goes south. With
the rain as cover, maybe we can put down just after dark. Think you can find a
way to get Sarah and meet us?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not even sure she can walk, at least not far, but
we'll be there.&quot; I was flashing on her back in the square, proclaim­ing
her happiness. Would I have to drag her out, carry her on my back? Well, I
would. &quot;There's some kind of 'cere­mony' on for tomorrow morning. The
Army's going to be here in double strength because of it, but maybe it'll make
for some confusion that'll help. Still, she's—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Damn, this is going to be big-time dicey.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Honey, let me tell you as much as I can about the
layout of this place. Just in case.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which I did. The main problem was, I didn't know exactly
where Sarah was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is there anybody there who could help you?&quot; he
asked when I'd finished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not hopeful.&quot; I paused. &quot;Listen, can you
get your hands on a gun or guns?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you . . . Don't even think about it! That's
the best way to guarantee we all get killed. I'm not taking on the Guatemalan
Armed Forces. And you're not either. We've got to keep this very low-tech. The
dark and the rain, that's what we use. They don't shoot back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment I wanted nothing more than to shoot Alex
Goddard. I'd have done it if I'd had the chance. Happily. But I knew Steve was
right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, look, what time?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We'll try to set down about, say—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was a crackle as the yellow diodes on the phone erupted
in a high-pitched whistle, cutting the connection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No! My God, had somebody been listening in?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So when exactly was he coming? Around dark? That would
probably be about eight o'clock. Or maybe nine . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was closing the phone case when I heard a sound from
outside, as though someone had passed the door, then come back to listen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All right. Get going.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I gathered the printouts, then headed back through the
laboratory, where I took a long, last look at the petri dishes being incubated.
Should I just dump them now? But then he'd know for sure that I knew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The time would come, and soon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I eased myself back into the fake-stone OR and closed the
door, the dawn outside was steeped in forest sounds, clacks and whistles and
chirps. That was good, because I needed some stray noise to mask what I was
going to do next. Take control.</span></p>

<h2><a name=bookmark27>Chapter Twenty-five</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I</span></b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
began by feeling along the fake-stone walls to find where the crevices were,
the doors that enclosed the medical in­struments. Somewhere, I was sure, there
was a cabinet that held a complete set of surgical equipment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I found the first crevice, I gave the wall on either
side a push and, sure enough, the panel was spring-loaded. Good. The side on
the right of the crevice popped open to reveal the microscope Goddard had used.
But nothing else was there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I moved on down the wall testing for cabinets, trying to
remember what Marcelina had done when Alex Goddard told her to prep the Mayan
woman. One after another the panels snapped open till . . . yes, this was the
one I wanted. Halle­lujah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The third drawer held the scalpels. I took out the largest I
could find, heavy and steel, then wedged it into the metal sliding mechanism
and snapped off the tip. Perfect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I felt like I was holding the key to my escape as I carefully
reclosed all the panels. Since there were no windows in the OR room, I slipped
back through the lab—it had now be­come a haunted place of monstrous obscenity
to me—and checked out the office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was still deserted, but now the hazy light of early day
was mingling with the sounds of nature seeping through the slatted window. As I
walked over to it, the cool, moist morn­ing air once again felt like freedom.
How long did I have before the clinic started stirring?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'd originally planned to try to unscrew some of the slats,
but that turned out to be unnecessary. The strips of wood were held in with
crude, rusty clamps, and one by one I began prying them out with the blunted
scalpel. I figured five slats should give me enough space to squeeze through,
and I'd already removed three when I heard a frustrated voice in Spanish just
down the hail. Uh-oh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Tengo que mear que mis dientes flotan!</i>&quot; It
was followed by the sound of boots headed toward the office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I ducked down behind a desk, holding my breath, but then the
footsteps marched past, headed for the front door of the clinic. That was when
I finally processed what he'd said: &quot;I've got to piss so bad my teeth are
floating.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So where was he headed?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Moments later I knew. I heard the noise of someone kick­ing
their way through the underbrush till they were right next to the window,
followed by the sound of a zipper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God, I thought, he's right here. Will he spot the miss­ing
slats?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I bit my lip as I listened to a member of the Guatemalan
Armed Forces vigorously urinate upon the north wall of Alex Goddard's clinic.
Well, I told myself, that's probably what they think of him. I'd like to do the
same.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then came a confirming re-zip, after which the sound of
slashing boots faded back into the distance. If he'd noticed the window I'd
just burgled, it hadn't alerted his curiosity. Moments later I heard his heavy
footsteps returning up the hall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jesus, two minutes more and I'd have been out there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was trembling, but I managed to finish prying out the last
two slats. I then pushed all five out onto the ground, hoping the clatter would
be lost in forest music, and climbed through after them, trying to be as quiet
as I could. I ended up going out headfirst and collapsing onto the ground in an
unceremonious crumple. Thirty seconds later, though, the slats were wedged
roughly back into place, and I'd discarded the broken scalpel in the jungle
underbrush. Yes!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now the cool air of freedom was all around me. My first small
step.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How long before Alex Goddard discovers I'm missing? Will I
have time to find Sarah, bring her to her senses, and hide her from him? A lot
would depend on what kind of physical and mental shape she was in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I passed around the parking lot, gray clouds were thick­ening
overhead and I noticed that half a dozen new olive-green Jeeps were parked
there. The Army was arriving in force, getting ready for God knows what. I took
one look at them and felt my breath start coming in bursts. Steve, we're going
to need our own kind of miracle. How are we going to get out of here?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I skirted the edges of the lot and reached the trail leading
down into the village. And I was trying to quell my pulse. What was down there?
With the dense rain forest arching over me, I felt as though I was entering a
domain of Maya dreamtime where the past lived again, only with a sinister
twist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The air in the dark groves was thick with the buzzing of
insects, harbingers of the coming rainstorm, but before long I caught a glimmer
of daylight ahead. Soon I emerged into a wide arbor that, after another hundred
feet, opened onto the central plaza and the pyramid. Now . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was daylight, but it also was . . . The sight took my
breath away. What was going on?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A milling horde of men was gathered in the square, and
resinous torches were flaming on each of the pyramid's tiers of steps. A lot of
drinking from clay jugs was getting under way, and the men were in the process
of painting their faces, stripes of black and white, with dark circles around
their eyes. Some also were applying rows of red-and-green-colored seeds to
their cheeks with white glue. The bizarreness of the scene rippled through me
like the shards of a dysfunctional dream. Jesus!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alex Goddard had said the ceremony got &quot;frenzied,&quot;
and now I was beginning to realize. . . . What were they getting ready to do?
Had I been wrong in thinking the classical Maya never got around to ripping out
hearts? Did that explain the half-dozen young Army privates loitering there at
the far side, rifles slung over their shoulders?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I melted back into the trees and studied the geometry of the
plaza, reconsidering my situation. I needed to find some way to get around it
and onto the cobblestone pathway at the far side, which led into the village.
Finally I decided I could skirt the periphery if I was careful not to advertise
my presence. Dawn had come and gone and the quick light of tropical day was
arriving, but everybody appeared to be pre­occupied with their nightmarish
preparations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thank God it worked. I weaved in and among the trees and in
five minutes I'd reached the central pathway, now deserted. Still barely
letting myself breathe, I turned back and gazed up at the pyramid. I had no idea
what was next, but I decided it would be my signpost, to help me keep my
bearings as I moved through the confusing, tree-shrouded huts of <i>Baalum</i>.
Except for the men in the square, the village now seemed deserted, though a
pack of brown dogs, curious and annoying, had spotted me and now circled around
to sniff. Don't bark, damn it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when I saw Marcelina, in her white shift, striding
through the crowd of drinking men like an alpha lioness part­ing a posturing
pride. My God. My heart stopped for a moment. Does Alex Goddard already know
I've fled and has he sent her to lure me back?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No way. I clenched my fists and kicked at the surly, long-
tailed mutts, still circling and nuzzling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she came closer, I saw she was smiling and carrying a
brown wicker basket. What. . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've brought you something,&quot; she announced as she
walked up, her dark eyes oddly kind. &quot;You must be starving by now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How did you know I was down here?&quot; Looking at her
earnest Mayan face, I suddenly wondered if she could have any idea what Alex
Goddard had done to Sarah, and to me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You were gone from your room,&quot; she declared,
settling the basket onto the walkway and beginning to open it. &quot;Where else
would you be?&quot; When I looked, I saw it had a sealed container of yogurt, a
banana, and two eggs, presum­ably hard-boiled—traditional &quot;safe&quot; food
for gringos in Third World places. &quot;I'd been planning to bring you down
today,&quot; she went on. &quot;They all want to meet you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was she coming to look after me? The more I examined her, the
more I began to suspect something else was going on. Would she help me get
Sarah out and away from Alex Goddard?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I want to find Sarah,&quot; I said. Why not start out
with the truth? &quot;Does he . . . Dr. Goddard know I'm here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's not here now,&quot; she said, her eyes shifting
down. &quot;He left for Guatemala City early this morning. I think to meet with
the Army. On business. . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes. His big Humvee hadn't been in the clinic's parking lot
when I went by. Why hadn't I noticed that? For the first time I felt the odds
were tipping. Now was going to be the perfect time to get Sarah. Yes. Yes. Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you want to see her, I can take you,&quot; Marcelina
offered, replacing the lid on the basket.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes, perfect. I wanted to hug her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then let's go right now&quot; And while I was at it, I
was determined to get through to this woman somehow, to enlist her help.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As we headed down the central walkway of the village, we
passed the rows of compounds where I'd seen the women that first morning. None
was in evidence now, and the gar­dens were empty, as though the entire
settlement had been evacuated. It felt very strange.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And what about those bizarre proceedings now under way in the
square? Was that going to interfere with getting Sarah out?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Marcelina.&quot; I pointed back toward the milling
plaza. &quot;What's that all about? The drinking and the—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's begun,&quot; she answered, both simple and vague.
&quot;They're getting ready.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I didn't like the way she said it. Her tone seemed to imply I
was involved somehow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ready for—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The ceremony. They like to drink a tree-bark liquor we
call <i>balche</i>. It's very strong and rancid.&quot; She smiled and touched
me. &quot;Take my advice and avoid it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I plan to.&quot; Why did she think I'd even be offered
it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As we hurried along, two women abruptly appeared on a porch,
bowed, and greeted us. Marcelina waved back, then went over and spoke earnestly
with them for a moment. Fi­nally she turned and motioned for me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They've invited you in.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Something about the easy way it all just &quot;happened&quot;
felt as though they'd been expecting me. Had Marcelina's trip down to the
village been part of a setup, wittingly or unwit­tingly?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I told them we could only stay for a minute,&quot; she
went on. I sensed she was reluctant, but felt we had no choice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The last thing I wanted to do was this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Marcelina, can't you tell them we'll come back
later?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's . . . it's important.&quot; She was beckoning for
me. &quot;Please.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, I thought, this could give me the time I need, the
personal moment, to get through to her. Even after I locate Sarah, spiriting
her out isn't going to be simple. I've got to make Marcelina understand what's
really going on, then get her to help us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As we headed through the yard, the women smiled, then
politely led us under the thatch overhang and into the hut. They both were
short and Maya-sturdy, with white shifts and broad faces, and they exuded a
confident intensity in their bearing, a powerful sense of self-knowledge. I
tried a phrase in Spanish, but they just stared at me as though they'd never
heard the language. Then I remembered my first attempt to ask about Sarah. The
women hadn't understood me then either. Or had they?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The room they ushered us into had no windows, but there was
cool, shadowy morning light filtering through the up­right wooden slats of the
walls, laying dim stripes across the earthen floor. A cooking fire smoldered in
a central hearth, and from the smoke-blackened roof beams dangled dried gourds,
bundles of tobacco, netted bags of onions and squash, and several leaf-wrapped
blocks of salt. The room smelled of ancient smoke, sweet and pungent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They immediately produced a calabash bowl with a gray liquid
inside, pronouncing the word <i>atole </i>as they urged it on me, smiling
expectantly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's our special drink,&quot; Marcelina explained. She
seemed to be wary, watching me closely as they handed it over. &quot;It's how
we welcome an honored guest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I wasn't sure how politic I ought to be. Third World food . .
.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Marcelina,&quot; I said, taking the bowl and trying to
smile. &quot;I'm not really—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You must have a little,&quot; she whispered back.
&quot;It would be very rude. . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, I thought, just a taste. I tried it and realized it was
a dense gruel of cornmeal and honey-water, like a lukewarm gluey porridge,
though with a bitter after-jolt. But I choked it down and tried to look
pleased. Marcelina urged me to have more—I took another small sip—and then they
pro­duced corn dumplings wrapped in large leaves, together with a pile of fiery
chiles and a bowl of squash, corn, and beans, all mixed together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After one bite, though, Marcelina reached out and—her eyes
downcast—whisked the bowls away, passing them back to the women. She said
something to them, then turned to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Eating too much would be as rude as not eating at
all.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was a cultural norm I didn't remember, and I sus­pected
she'd just changed her mind about the wisdom of my eating local food.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I smiled at the women and used some of my so-so Spanish to
offer them thanks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Muchas gracias</i>.&quot; I nodded toward the bowls.
&quot;<i>Esta es muy delicioso</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>They beamed as though they understood me. Who could
say? But they'd been intensely interested in watching me eat, even more than
Marcelina.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Work on her. Now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Marcelina.&quot; I turned to her, only vaguely noticing
she hadn't had a bite. &quot;Do you understand why Dr. Goddard moved me down to
the operating room yesterday? There in the clinic? What did he tell you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He said it was for special tests.&quot; Her voice was
gentle through the gloom. &quot;You were very . . . sleepy. You must have been
very, very tired. But he told me something in your blood work was unusual, so
he had me bring you down for a pelvic exam. I gave you a sedative&quot;—she was
pointing at the Band-Aid still on my arm—&quot;the way we always do. But then
he said you were fine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you realize he did things to my body I didn't agree
to?&quot; I studied her trusting Mayan face and tried to get a sense of how
much she knew about what was going on. That was when I first became sure of an
increasing disquiet in her eyes, as she kept glancing away. Why was she so un­comfortable
talking about Alex Goddard? &quot;And I think he did some of those same things
to Sarah.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dr. Goddard tried to help her in many ways when she was
here before.&quot; Marcelina's tone had become odd and dis­tant. &quot;Now he
wants to help you too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes, there was definitely something uneasy in her eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Before he came here,&quot; she went on, trying to look
at me, &quot;<i>Baalum </i>was just a poor, simple village. Many children died
of diseases. So I left and went to Guatemala City to study. To become a
public-health nurse. Then after he came here, I moved back to help him with his
clinic, the children.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>She was trying to make a case for him, and I noticed
she'd avoided the actual question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now <i>Baalum </i>has become a special place,&quot; she
said fi­nally. &quot;A place of miracles. And if a woman from outside comes,
she can be part of that. When Sara was here before, I started teaching her to
speak our language, and the others did too. She truly wanted to be part of his
miracles. Some­times we don't understand how they happen, but he has great
medical powers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>One thing's for sure, I thought. He's got plenty of power over
the people here, including you. The whole place has been brainwashed. I looked
her over and realized she'd just gone on mental autopilot. She wants to be
loyal to him, and she can't let herself believe there's something rotten in the
&quot;special&quot; paradise of <i>Baalum</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Listen,&quot; I said, getting up, &quot;I need
to go see Sarah right now. Her father's been in the hospital, and he's not
well. I spoke with him yesterday, and he's very worried about her. I know Dr.
Goddard is treating her, but it's better if I just take her home
immediately.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>More and more I was beginning to suspect this detour for the
two women had been a diversion, an attempt to stall. Marcelina had set it up.
Maybe she wanted to tell me some­thing, and she didn't have the nerve to do it
point-blank.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Families are very important,&quot; she said, sounding
sincere. &quot;We'll go now.&quot; She spoke to the women briefly, an animated
benediction that seemed to leave her even more disturbed. As we headed out and
on down the path, I again wondered what was really happening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When we reached the end of the long &quot;street,&quot; the
arched arbors still above us, she stopped in front of an odd stone building
unlike any of the others and pointed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is where she likes to be,&quot; she said quietly.
&quot;Except for the pyramid, it's the most sacred place in Baalum.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The doorway was a stone arch about five feet high and pointed
at the top like a tiny Gothic cathedral.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What . . . is this?&quot; I felt as though I was about
to enter something from the Temple of Doom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It was once the royal bath,&quot; she explained.
&quot;In ancient times heated rocks were brought in, with spring water from a
sacred <i>cenote</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We walked through the portal and entered a room
whose roof was a stone latticework that let the gray daylight just filter
through. The space was vast, with carved and colored glyphs all around the
walls, while the air was filled with clouds of incense from pots along the
floor. It felt like a smoky pagan church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At the far end was a large stone platform, and in the dap­pled,
hazy light I could see it was embossed along its sides with carved and painted
classical scenes and glyphs, glisten­ing little red and green and blue pictures
of faces and figures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My eyes finally started adjusting to the shadows, and I
realized the platform had been fitted with a covering across the top, a jaguar
skin over bundled straw, and a tiny form was lying on it, wearing a white
shift. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dear God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgy, I've been so hoping you'd come,&quot; Sarah
said, rising up and holding out her hands. Then she slid her feet around onto
the rough stone floor and managed to steady herself. Her shift was wrinkled
now, but she still was wearing the brown slippers and the braided leather
waist-cinch. She appeared sleepy, though her eyes were sparkling and she seemed
to have more strength than she'd had when I first saw her out in the square. I
looked at her and weighed the chances she could walk. Possibly. But I'd carry
her if I had to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sar, honey, we're going home now,&quot; I said, finally
finding my voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She didn't respond at first, just turned to caress the deco­rated
sides of the platform. &quot;I've been wanting to show you this, Morgy. It
tells my story.&quot; Her voice sounded as if it were coming from a long way
off, as though through a dense haze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Please, we don't have time for stories.&quot; Was she
hearing me at all? &quot;Let's just—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;See,&quot; she went on, ignoring me as she pointed
down, &quot;that's the Cosmic Monster, that one there with maize sprout­ing out
of his forehead. And that man next to him with a flint knife is my father,
letting blood from his penis. He's the king. And that one there is me, Lady
Jaguar. He gave my name to this place.&quot; She paused to reverently touch the
carved stone. &quot;Look, I've just stuck a stingray spine through my tongue
and put my blood in the <i>copal</i> censer there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sar, please—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Here, see it?&quot; She was pointing to a section at
the very end. &quot;That's the two-headed Vision Serpent up above me. He's the
god Kukulkan . . . or something. I've made him come to me by giving him my
blood. I'm—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sar, what in heaven's name is going on with you?&quot;
I grabbed her and in spite of myself, shook her. Jesus! The whole scene left me
in shock. She was sinking back deeper into her fantasy world. Was she taking
the drug again, I won­dered and fantasizing she was some dead Mayan princess?
Please, God no.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when I saw Marcelina walk over to a shelf along the
wall and lift down another clay-pot incense burner, along with a small white
brick. What—?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, yes!&quot; Sarah exclaimed moving quickly over to
her. &quot;Let's do it for Morgy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Marcelina nodded warily and handed her the white brick, then
turned to me. &quot;She likes to do incense. It always calms her. This is <i>copal</i>,
what the shamans use.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I watched while Sarah shakily began crumbling pieces of the
sticky substance into the pot. My God I thought, she's truly, truly lost it.
Next she inserted dry tinder and began trying to knock sparks into it with a
piece of hard black jade and a flint. But she was too weak, and finally
Marcelina had to take the flint and do it for her. Then, as the gray smoke
started billowing out, Marcelina began a long chant, shrill and strangely
melodic. I felt a chill creep down my back. When she finished she turned her
dark eyes on me sadly, waiting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What were you saying?&quot; I asked finally, sensing
she wanted me to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was singing from the Popol Vuh.&quot; Then she
translated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Holy
earth, giver of life, </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Help us

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>The God

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Wait a minute. What's she saying?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who's the God of the House of Darkness?&quot; Could she
be talking about Alex Goddard?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I didn't want to do it,&quot; she blurted out, reaching
out to me, her eyes even sadder. &quot;But he said you're the new special one.
We had to.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What the hell was she talking about? Had to what? Did it have
something to do with my &quot;visit&quot; to the women in the hut?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Please stay here with us,&quot; she pleaded as she took
my hand. &quot;Don't go.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stay? Don't even think about it. I had Sarah halfway to
freedom. While the Army was still getting its act together, we could lose
ourselves someplace in the forest where no­body would find us, and when Steve
got here tonight . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sar, come on, it's time.&quot; I pulled away from
Marcelina and slipped my arm around her. &quot;Nothing here is what you think
it is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are we leaving?&quot; she asked, her eyes blank.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, honey, we're leaving. This very minute.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The dense forest was all about us, and I'd just carry her
into it if I had to. In the coming storm, nobody was going to find . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's when I noticed I was beginning to have gastric
rumblings. Damn. Never, ever eat &quot;native&quot; food, no matter what the social
pressure. That damned &quot;visit&quot; . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I turned to ask Marcelina if she would help me get Sarah
outside, I noticed she'd been joined by the two women, both still in their
white shifts, who'd just fed me the sickly</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>sweet <i>atole</i>.
And more women were behind them, all staring at me, expectant, as though
wondering what I would do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe it was my imagination, or the dizziness that was
abruptly growing around me, but it also seemed they'd painted their faces with
streaks of white, designs like the men in the square were putting on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She's going to be all right,&quot; Marcelina was
saying. &quot;But we have to get you back now. You'll need your strength.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I needed it then. My stomach had really begun to gyrate, and
my vision had started growing colored. I noticed I was sweating, even though
the day was cooling down. Actually, I felt as though I was about to pass out.
What had those women fed me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was finally dawning on me that Marcelina's fearfulness
back in the hut had nothing to do with betraying Alex God­dard. It was because
she knew she was betraying me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, damn her, I'm not going to let Alex Goddard win, no
matter what.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Marcelina, please help me. I've got to get Sarah out of
here. Now. I don't know what poison drug he's giving her, but he's driving her
insane.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We'll take care of her,&quot; she said. But I could
barely make out the words. They echoed bouncing around in my head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm really getting dizzy.&quot; I glanced over again at
the women standing by the door. &quot;Please tell me what they—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The elixir,&quot; she said. &quot;For tomorrow at
sunup. That's when you'll see his real power.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'd begun experiencing white spots before my eyes—and for
some reason I had a vision of the Army Jeeps parked up the hill. I didn't know
how the two were connected but in my jumbled thoughts they seemed to be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just get Sarah and get out into the air. Walk, don't think,
and you can do it. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I pulled her next to me and struggled toward the door, the
women studying us, unmoving.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgy, I've missed you so much,&quot; Sarah was saying,
slipping her arms around my neck to help herself walk. &quot;I'm . . . I'm
ready to go home.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've missed you too.&quot; I think my heart was
bursting as I urged her on through the stone portico. At last. Had some­thing
clicked that freed her from Alex Goddard? Maybe her mind was finally becoming
her own.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When we got outside, the skies were growing ever more
foreboding, storm clouds looming. Steve had been right about the coming rain,
but now it seemed the perfect cover for us to just get out. I took a deep
breath of the misty air and forced myself to start helping Sarah up the
cobblestone path.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sar, you can walk, I know you can. Be strong. For both
of us. I'm . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I felt myself sinking slowly to the cold stones of the walk­way,
the hard abrasion against my knees, Sarah tumbling forward as I pulled her down
on top of me, Marcelina's arms around me trying to hold me up. It was the last
real sensation I would remember.</span></p>

sylphlike presence, as I watched myself drift up the steps of the pyramid there
in the square, my senses waxing and waning like the waves on a distant ocean
shore. There seemed to be rain, or fog, or smoke, but it had a luminous, purple
cast one moment, a Day-Glo orange the next. In fact, all the colors were
swirling and changing, shimmering from hue to hue. A pack of howler monkeys was
cavorting up and down the steps on my left, like circus Harlequins in electric
red-and-blue suits, doing pratfalls and huffing as they flew through the air
and tumbled one over another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sarah was floating silently beside me, but where was Steve?
Had he come? Were we escaping?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No. I sensed his face drifting across my sight like a cartoon
cloud before dissolving into nothingness. He wasn't here. I was having the
eeriest dream I'd ever had.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I reached the stone-paved platform at the pinnacle, I
felt Alex Goddard clasp my arm and turn me around to face the plaza below.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They are waiting,&quot; he said, pointing toward the
hazy square.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I looked down, and at first I couldn't see anything except
rain and smoke, but then slowly a crowd materialized. The scattering of men I'd
seen earlier had become an undulating sea of upturned faces painted with
stripes and swirling circles of blue and white and red, a torch-lit garden of
brilliant blos­soms. They all were looking up at us, at Sarah and me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next he held out a mirror whose reflecting surface was a
polished silver metal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Behold yourself, Morgan. As befits a royal one, a
special one, your nose has been built up with clay and pierced with lustrous
blue feathers and a giant topaz. Your front teeth have been filed to a point
and inlaid with jewels, your royal skull has been shaped back and
flattened.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I gazed into the mirror and gasped. I was monstrous, a
Halloween harpy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he moved over to a waist-high censer stationed there on
the edge of the platform and began adding balls of sticky white <i>copal</i>
resin, together with bark and grasses, which he ignited by the quick friction
of a fire stick spun by a bow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally he turned to me and held out his hands. &quot;Now we
will make a miracle, the miracle of <i>Baalum</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Heavy smoke from the censer was pouring out into the rainy
sky as we started a stiff <i>pas de deux</i>, the strains of a clay flute
drifting around us. Was it the &quot;ceremony&quot;? Was I dreaming it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the incense billowed, our Maya dreamtime dance be­came
ever more intense, and then a faint form began to writhe up out of the haze
between us, an undulating serpent the deep color of jade. As Alex Goddard
wrapped his arms around it, it began to form into two dark heads, then
pirouette above us. Finally, as the two-headed specter opened its mouths and
gazed down on the platform, Sarah stepped to­ward it and held out her arms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sar, no!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I screamed to her to get back, but as I did, the . . . thing
reached down and swallowed her in flames. It was the Vi­sion-Serpent come to
receive her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sarah . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Can you get up now?&quot; said a voice, cutting through
the haze that enveloped my consciousness. At first I thought it was more of the
dream, but then someone was touching me and I opened my eyes to see Marcelina
standing beside the bed I was in, dressed in white and holding a candle. For a
moment I thought I was still atop the rainy pyramid but then I felt the
moistness of the sheets and realized the storm Id been dreaming of was being
blown in through the slats of the windows. I was shivering.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Marcelina, where's Sarah?&quot; The nightmare had
seemed so real, and now I was hallucinating, having flashes of colors I didn't
want to see. &quot;I just had the most horrible dream. I was on the pyramid and
there was smoke, rain and some kind of ghastly—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's the elixir. From the toad. It makes you dream
dreams of the Old Ones.&quot; She took my hand. &quot;She's resting now. He
gave her something to calm her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>More drugs, I thought angrily.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I caught the &quot;he.&quot; Alex Goddard must be back.
Everything had gone wrong.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've got to get her and—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not now,&quot; Marcelina went on, helping me up.
&quot;Come. I want to show you the true miracle of <i>Baalum</i>. Now is the
time you should know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The upstairs hallway was dimly illuminated by rows of lights
along the floor as she led me forward. There also was total silence, except for
the occasional whimper of a baby in one of the rooms. Where was she taking me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When she stopped in front of the third door from the end of
the hall, I tried to get my mental bearings. I was still hallucinating; in
control of only half my mind to the point where I wasn't sure I could find my
hand in front of my face. But then she tapped on the door and when she heard a
voice inside, something in the Kekchi dialect, she gently pushed it open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When we moved inside, the room was dark and there was no
sound, except a gasp from the bed when the woman re­alized I was a gringo. The
dim slant of illumination from the doorway revealed a small night lamp just
above the head of her bed, and Marcelina reached for it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the light came on, a pale glow filling the room, I no­ticed
the woman was staring at me, her eyes wide and fright­ened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She's afraid you've come for her child,&quot; Marcelina
whis­pered, pointing toward the bassinet. &quot;She knows we have to give him
back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The woman was pure Maya, a powerful visage straight off that
upright stele in the square. I walked over and took her hand, hoping to calm
her fears. Then I lifted her hand to my cheek and realized my face was moist
with tears. I held it there for a long moment, till the alarm in her eyes dimin­ished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her newborn infant was sleeping quietly in a crib right next
to her, on the opposite side from the table. When I looked closely at him, I
finally understood everything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I laid her hand back onto the bed and walked around. While
the woman watched, I pulled away the stripped red and green coverlet and lifted
out her groggy little boy, tender and vulnerable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He made a baby's protest as I cradled him, then began
sleepily probing my left breast, making me feel sad I had no milk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's okay,&quot; I whispered, first to him and then to
his mother. &quot;<i>Esta bien</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Tz'ac Tzotz</i>,&quot; the woman said, pointing at
him. I could feel her deep, maternal love.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His name?&quot; I asked in English, before I thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When Marcelina translated, the woman smiled and nod­ded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the blond-haired Tz'ac Tzotz started to sniffle, so I
kissed him gently, turned, and took the woman's hand again. There was nothing
else I could do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tz'ac Tzotz was Sarah incarnate. This was no hallucina­tion.
He had her special blue eyes and her steep cheeks, her high brow. I was holding
her child.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They are sent from Kukulkan,&quot; Marcelina was
saying, &quot;the white god of the plumed serpent. Then there's the cere­mony
on the pyramid and they go back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The woman was staring at me, seemingly awestruck. Then she
pointed at Tz'ac Tzotz and at me, saying something to Marcelina. Finally the
woman bowed her head to me with great reverence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She says he looks so much like you,&quot; Marcelina ex­plained.
&quot;You are surely the special one. The new bride.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was still speechless, but then I noticed the baby had a
little silver jaguar amulet tied around his wrist with a silken string, and on
the back—as on Kevin's and Rachel's—were rows of lines and dots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It finally dawned on me. They were digits, written in the
archaic Maya script. What could they be, maybe his birth­day? No, I realized,
that was far too simplistic. This was the original bar code; it was his <i>Baalum
</i>&quot;serial number.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>For a long moment it felt as if time had stopped.
Sarah, and now me—we'd been lured here to provide the life force for Mayan
surrogate mothers. This whole elaborate recrea­tion wasn't about rainforest
drugs and research into fertility; it was just a cover to use the bodies of
these intensely be­lieving Native Americans. Alex Goddard had perpetrated the
greatest systematic exploitation of another race since slavery. The difference
was, he'd found a way to get them to give themselves willingly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Baalum</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
was definitely a place of miracles. There could scarcely be another isolated
spot on earth where he could find this many sincere, trusting people with
powerful beliefs he could prostitute. And all of it hidden deep in an ancient
rainforest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But I had to be sure. I turned around, leaving Marcelina to
watch in confusion, and marched out into the hall and into the next room. The
Maya mother there cried out in shock as I unceremoniously strode over to her
crib and checked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her baby was the same. Sarah stamped all over him. My God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I went back, Marcelina was still trying to calm Tz'ac
Tzotz's mother with her bedside manner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I stood looking at them, the extent of what was going on
finally settled in. All those new babies at Quetzal Manor, even Kevin and
Rachel—they all looked alike because they all were from the same woman. The one
who was here before Sarah. And now hers were ready.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was going to be next. The new &quot;bride.&quot; Those
fresh petri dishes down in the lab . . . My God, why didn't I destroy them when
I had the chance?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So whose sperm would he use? Of course. It would be from the
man Alan Dupre was going to deliver to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Marcelina, don't you realize what's happening?&quot; I
wanted to pound some sense into her. They didn't have to let him do this to
them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I know that with miracles must come sadness,&quot; she
said, reaching to touch Tz'ac Tzotz's tiny brow. &quot;We all under­stand
that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's not a miracle. It's science, don't you realize? <i>Ciencia</i>.
He's using you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We know he does many things that are magic. He makes
powerful medicines from the plants we bring him, and when women want to bear a
child—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, Marcelina.&quot; I felt my heart go out to her, and
to all the others. &quot;It's black magic. It's all a lie.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The first thing to do was go down to the laboratory and dump
every last one of my petri dishes into the sink, ova and all. Destroy the nest,
then call Steve and warn him. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I glanced at my watch. NO! The time was 4:58 A.M. He was
coming at nine o'clock last night. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was standing there in horror, unnatural colors flitting
across my vision, when I heard . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's almost morning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I jumped as Alex Goddard walked into the room, dressed in
white, hair falling around his shoulders. He took Tz'ac Tzotz from his crib,
checked the number on his amulet, and then absently put him back. Next he
examined me, his eyes brimming with concern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How're you feeling?&quot; He placed his hand on my
brow. When I looked around for Marcelina, I realized she'd van­ished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where's Steve?&quot; I felt the bottom dropping out of
my world, my whole body trembling. &quot;If you've harmed so much as a hair on
his head, I'll—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's here,&quot; he said quietly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I want to see him.&quot; Dear God, what had I done? I
wanted to die.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's been given something to help him rest. Are you
sure you want to disturb him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I told you I want to see him.&quot; I could barely get
out the words. &quot;Now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you insist. He's just downstairs.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We slowly walked down the marble steps, my mind flood­ing
with more and more hallucinations. When we reached the first floor, he opened
the door of a room adjacent to his office. I realized the window slats were
open, sending a rush of moist air across my face. Then he motioned me forward
and clicked on the bedside light.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Steve was there on the bed, comatose. I walked over and
lifted his upper torso, then cradled his head in my arms. Baby, I love you.
Please forgive me. Please.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His eyes were firmly shut and he didn't stir in the
slightest. He was in a deathlike stupor, and there were large bruises on his
face and a bandage across his nose. Then his bed shift fell open and I noticed
another bandage on his groin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You've already done it!&quot; I whirled back, ready to
kill the bastard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As I said, he was injected with a mild sedative.&quot;
He had walked over and started taking Steve's pulse. &quot;Given the . . .
condition he was in, I decided to go with the simplest pro­cedure possible.
After he was brought in, I made a small incision in the <i>vas deferens </i>and
extracted a substantial quan­tity of motile sperm.&quot; He was turning down
the lights. &quot;Don't worry. I've performed the procedure before. The last
was a Swedish tourist who was in a car accident up by Lake Atitlan and then lay
in a coma in Guatemala City for weeks on end.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I listened to him, my mind racing. I'd thought Kevin and
Rachel looked Nordic, big and blond. That Swede must have been their father.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Those ova of mine you took, the way you stole Sarah's,
and all the other women you've brought here—you don't use them for
research.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have ample leftover embryonic material here for that.&quot;
He started helping me onto the bed next to Steve. Now his face was undulating
through my vision, as though I were seeing it in a wavy mirror. &quot;Please
understand, it's very ex­pensive to run a laboratory up here. But the good I'm
do­ing—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're a criminal.&quot; I remembered the frightened
eyes of the women upstairs and felt myself seething with anger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No! I am, in my special way, giving them back a small
part of what they had taken away by people exactly like us. I'm providing them
proof, living proof, their truths are still powerful.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He strolled over to the window and looked out. &quot;The
women come to me for my blessing whenever they hope to bear a child. They know
that if they wish, I can cause their first child to be a descendant of their
white deity Kukulkan. For them it is a sacred event.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They believe that?&quot; It was sickening. I felt a
knot grow­ing in my stomach, even as my hallucinations flashed ever bolder,
bright rainbows that flitted about the room, then wound themselves around me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A great philosopher once said, All religions are true.'
Who are we to judge?&quot; He paused. &quot;Let me try and explain something.
Those patterns you see the women weaving on the fabrics down in Baalum, those
patterns are actually just like the designs on that thousand-year-old pyramid.
But though that pyramid had been buried and lost to them for so many years,
they still made the designs all those years, be­cause those symbols are a road
map of their unseen world. Not the forest here where we are now, but their real
world, where the gods dwell who rule the lightning bolts, the ger­mination of
corn.&quot; He was at the door, preparing to leave, but he paused. &quot;They
also understand the . . . special infants who come are miracles that must be
returned. They receive but they also must give. Now they wish you to be part of
that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With that he closed the door with a swing of his long hair, a
slam followed by a hard click.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='color:windowtext'>A</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>s I watched him depart,
hallucinations swirling through my brain like furious fireworks, I had a
bizarre thought. In an ancient rainforest all things are still possible. The
old fairy tales we grew up with mostly took place in a deep wood where evil
could lurk unfettered. Today, though, the earth's forests no longer symbolize
the unknowable dark within us. Nowadays, the ogres of our nightmares descend
from outer space or even from our inner selves, places we can't physi­cally
know or subdue. Here, though, at this very moment, Steve and Sarah and I were
marooned in a thousand-year-old forest where horror still lived.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I got off the bed and steadied myself, breathing deeply,
forcing my brain to clear. Steve was wearing a shift, but his clothes were
hanging from a hook on the door. For a long moment I just stared at the bruises
on his face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;God, baby, what did he do to you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No answer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come on, love. Please wake up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He didn't move, but his breathing was normal, not labored. I
immediately decided I'd slap him around if I had to, any­thing to get him going
and able to walk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Honey, wake up. Please.&quot; I pulled his feet out of
the bed and slid them around and onto the linoleum floor. I didn't know what
kind of sedative he'd been injected with, but if I had to shake him out of it,
fine. This was no time for half measures. &quot;Come <i>on</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I pulled him to his feet and dragged him across the
floor to the slatted window at the rear of the room, where the predawn sounds
of the forest beyond filled the air, mingled with the rain. What I needed was a
gallon of black coffee, but the wet breeze would have to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It took ten minutes of working on him, with me barely able to
hold a grasp on my own reality, but then his eyelids began to flutter. I kept
talking to him, pleading and badger­ing, and when he finally started coming
around, I began to walk him back and forth in front of the window.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Steve, I thought, I'm so sorry, so terribly sorry I dragged
you into this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Can I please lie down?&quot; His timorous voice
startled me, but it gave me a burst of hope. Come <i>on</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Baby, just walk a little more. Try to get the
blood flowing and flush the damned chemicals out of your brain.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgy, are you okay?&quot; His eyes had finally started
to focus. And the first thing he asked about was <i>me</i>. I impul­sively
hugged him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm going to be.&quot; I pulled back and examined him.
&quot;You know where you are?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He grinned with only half his face, and I could tell even
that hurt. Then he stared around the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell you one thing,&quot; he said, &quot;this ain't
Kansas anymore. Last thing I remember is, Alan and I were setting down. Then
out of nowhere, your Colonel Ramos and about twenty kid soldiers with AK-47's
were all over us.&quot; He groaned. &quot;They took me and then he told Dupre
to get back in the chopper and disappear. I think that son of a bitch tipped
Ramos off we were coming. Then Ramos worked me over and gave me an injection.
About five minutes later I passed out. It's the last thing I remember.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ramos. Was he going to kill us both, now that Alex God­dard
had gotten everything he wanted? I thought about it and decided this was not
the moment to share that possibility with Steve. Instead I turned him around
and lifted up his head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you really awake?&quot; I loved this poor, beat-up
man. More than anything, I just wanted to hold him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not . . . but I'd damned well better be.&quot; He
tried unsteadily, to straighten up. &quot;Morgy, before he put me away, that
Ramos bastard was talking about me, and you, in the past tense. Like we'd
already been 'disappeared.' He didn't know I speak Spanish. What the hell's
going on?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I wasn't sure how to tell him. But I was getting that super
energy God gives you when you realize life is no longer a game. We had to get
focused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Baby, where's your passport?&quot; I asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked around then pointed to his battered camera bag in
the corner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's in there. Or was. Central America. Never leave
home without it.&quot; He grimaced then lightly pushed me away and stood by
himself. &quot;Jesus, do you know what they're doing? You were right all along.
They're selling kids in the States. That Ramos prick is running the operation,
not to mention Alex Goddard's slice of the action. And somebody at the American
embassy here is handling all the paperwork, so they can grease everything
through the INS. But I still don't understand how it is we're—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Honey, I know exactly what's happening.&quot; I'd long
since figured out that Alex Goddard and Colonel Ramos were working hand in
glove. But I still couldn't bring myself to tell him how he and I were going to
be used. It was just too sick. &quot;Listen, not long from now I think I'm
supposed to be taken down there to the village for some kind of rite, as part
of this whole disgusting operation, and then after that he's going to use . . .
You don't want to hear. We've—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, Ramos and a bunch of G-2 thugs are here to
take away a batch of little kids,&quot; he rambled on, not seeming to hear
anything I was saying. He was off in his own world, trying to sort out things
in his head. &quot;But what I can't figure is, how can they just take children
from here and nobody tries to stop them? Are these <i>indigena</i> so
terrified—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Listen, please.&quot; Now my hallucinations
were returning in spite of all I could do, trails of light that glimmered off
all the objects in the room, and I didn't know how much longer I'd be coherent.
I'd have to talk fast. &quot;We've got to get Sarah before daylight. She's down
in the village. I tried to get her out of there yesterday, but—&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is she okay?&quot; He stared at me and his eyes cleared
for a moment. &quot;I mean, is she able to—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, she's not okay. She's hallucinating worse than
ever. I'm sure he's giving her more drugs. Really heavy stuff.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So how—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hopefully, we're going right this minute. There's a
river. But if that doesn't work out, there's something I can do to buy us a
month's time. Alex Goddard's got a laboratory here, just down the hall, in back
of his office. It's the evil center of this place. So if I can get in there and
dump all his petri dishes, his in-vitro culture mediums . . . Baby, it's all so
dis­gusting. But I'm going to take care of it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was starting to have real trouble just stringing words
together into sentences. My hallucinations were still grow­ing, the loud
whispers of light, but I did manage to tell him how I thought we could get
Sarah and elude the Army, if we did it before sunup, though my plan probably
came out pretty jumbled. Yet I felt that if we did it together, we could take
care of each other. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then, with my remaining strength, I launched into action.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me check the hall. I just want to shut down his
lab. Call it . . . call it insurance. Five minutes, and then we'll be out of here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It also would be a kind of justice, to even the score for
what he'd done to Sarah and to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I leaned Steve back against the wall, then walked slowly
across the tile floor to the door and tested it. Surprise, sur­prise, it was
locked. I again tried the knob, an old one, then again, but it wouldn't budge,
just wiggled slightly. He'd locked us in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I remembered the time Steve and I were in a similar
situation. When we got locked in my room at the Oloffson in Port-au-Prince,
he'd just taken his Swiss Army knife and unscrewed the knob, then clicked it
open. He'd made it look like a piece of cake, but he had a way of doing that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was barely conscious, so this time I'd have to do it
myself. I glanced around at his bag.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is your Swiss still in there?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think . . .&quot; His mind seemed to be wandering.
Then he gave a weak thumbs-up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I went over and zipped it open. Be there, I prayed. We really
could use a break.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I rummaged through telephoto lenses and film canisters and
underwear. Then I found it, zipped inside a water-repel­lent baggie and stuck
in a side pouch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I snapped it open and went to work, him watching me, his head
nodding as he struggled to stay conscious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The main difference between this time and Haiti was, here I
didn't know what was on the other side and I was having hallucinations of
multicolored snakes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're doing great,&quot; he said finally, seeming to
come a bit more alive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And I was. Out with the screws, off with the knob, in with
the small blade, and click. Maybe we just think men's me­chanical skills are
genetically hard-wired. Maybe it's all a secret plot to elicit awe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I closed the knife and shoved it back into his bag, then
turned to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Honey, I'm just going to be a second. While I'm gone,
practice walking.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Be careful, please.&quot; He gave a cautionary wave.
&quot;They don't want us leaving here alive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just get ready.&quot; I quietly pulled back the door
and peered out into the dark hallway. It was empty, abandoned, no snakes, with
only a light breeze flowing through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I stepped out, the fresh air hit my face and I had a
moment of intensity that made me realize what I really wanted to do, first and
foremost, was see Tz'ac Tzotz one last time. A last farewell to one of Sarah's
children. Stupid, yes, a private folly of the heart, but I had to do it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was halfway down the hall, experiencing flashes of color
before my eyes, when I heard a voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They're all praying for you. It's almost time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I turned back, startled, barely able to see. Finally I made
out Marcelina, in her white shift. We were standing a few feet from the stairs,
where I wanted to go, and I was tripping, my reality almost gone. I think she
knew that, because she reached out to help me stand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Marcelina, where's Sarah?&quot; I grasped her hand,
which helped me to keep my balance. &quot;Is she still down there in that . . .
place?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She's been so looking forward to the ceremony. She
wants them to bring her—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You don't know where she is?&quot; I realized nothing
was going to go the way I'd hoped it would.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They all love her. They're taking good care of
her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I love her too. And I have to get her. Now.&quot;
I was whispering to her, trying to save my strength. &quot;Marcelina, promise
me you'll stop all this. It's so horrible. So sad.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's our life,&quot; she whispered back, then turned
her face away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I didn't know what else to say, and I was terrified Alex
Goddard might materialize, so without another word, I pulled away and started
up the steps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I reached the top of the stairs, the hallway was lighted
by the string of bulbs along the floor, and I made my way as fast as I could to
my room at the end. I pulled my passport out of my bag, along with a charge
card, slipped them both into my pants pocket, and headed back down the hall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I got to the door of the room where Tz'ac Tzotz and his
mother were, I gave it a gentle push and peered in, but the glow from the lamp
above the bed showed it and the crib were both empty. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No! They must have already taken the children. Next they'd be
coming for me. I realized I'd been a fool not to head straight for the lab. I
should have just gone—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The room went completely dark, together with the hallway, a
pitch-black that felt like a liquid washing over me. The main power, somewhere,
had abruptly died, or been deliber­ately shut off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I heard a thunder of footsteps pounding up the steps,
hard boots on the marble.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I made a dash, hoping to slip past them in the dark hall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'd reached the top of the stairs when I felt a hand brush
against my face, then a grip circle around my biceps. Some­body had been too
quick.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I brought my elbow around hoping to catch him in the face,
bring him down, but instead it slammed against some­thing metal, which
clattered onto the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Chingado</i>!&quot; came a muffled voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I drew back and swung, and this time my arm scraped
hard against the flesh of a face and the bastard staggered backward his grip
loosening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I twisted away and dropped to the floor to begin searching
for what had fallen. Surely it was a pistol.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The marble was cold against my bare arms as I swept my hands
across the floor. Then I ran my fingers down the edge of the stair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And there it was, on the first step. My left hand closed
around the cold barrel of an automatic. I shifted it to my right, grasping the
plastic grip, not entirely sure what I should do with it. But at least I had a
gun. I'd never actually held a real one before, but it was heavy and I assumed
it was ready to fire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was halfway down the first set of stairs, on my way to the
landing, when I felt an arm slip around my neck. I ducked and twisted away,
stumbling down the last three or four steps, and landed on my feet, staggering
back against the wall to regain my balance. All I knew was, the next steps
loomed somewhere to my right. Just a few more feet . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But he was there again, moving between me and the final
stairs. Get around him, I told myself, but at that moment he grabbed me at the
waist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dancing in the dark, but the swirl had no music and no swing,
just a quick, dizzying pirouette. I aimed the pistol as close as I could to his
face and pulled the hard metal trigger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Mierda!</i>&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Blinding light, a face lost in the burst of flame,
stars filling my head. The fiery explosion tongued out past his ear like a
brilliant sword of reds and yellows, sending a round off into space. The noise
left a ringing in my ears and multicol­ored hues stuttering across my eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It hit me who I'd just seen. It was Ramos. With a gun! Shit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The flash of my pistol had given me the advantage for a
second, since I knew it was coming, and with that edge I swung an elbow across his
chin, then kneed him in the groin. It should have been enough to bring him
down, but instead he merely sank to one knee and redoubled his grip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hey, I thought, maybe I know something he doesn't. How to
take a fall. I'd seen enough movie stunts to know what you're supposed to do.
It'd be risky, but I knew I wasn't going to win a wrestling match.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I opened up with the automatic, firing everywhere again and
again and again, getting off five rounds in a crescendo of light and sound,
like a huge firecracker in my hand, enough to illuminate the stairwell like a
strobe and catch him off guard. In that fleeting moment I slipped a foot behind
his ankle and shoved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I think I yelled as I felt myself being pulled forward. Then
I realized he was wearing a heavy bracelet that had tangled in my hair. I'd
been planning to roll down the remaining stairs, protecting my head, and let
him bounce, but the pull of his bracelet ruined it. I felt myself being swept
into empty space, my gun flying away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then something glanced off my face, the wooden banister of
the stair, which had mysteriously come up to meet me. I turned and felt his
body beneath mine, arms flailing, a soft landing, till we rolled and I was
beneath him again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I struck out, a right fist, and he fell away, his bracelet
disentangling as he tumbled farther down the stairs. Then I rose and tried to
take a step, but it wasn't there. In the pitch dark the angle was wrong, off by
just inches, and as I toppled forward into empty space I reached out, taking a
handful of dark air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally I felt something clenching my wrist, and the next</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>thing I knew
I was being swung around. I twisted sideways one last time, but then my head
hit the wall. The hard marble caught me just above the ear, and I saw the
darkness of the space grow brilliantly light, then transmute to vibrant colors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Or maybe the hall lights had come back on. I only know I felt
a set of arms encircle me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come,&quot; Alex Goddard was saying as he lifted me up.

<h2><a name=bookmark30>Chapter Twenty-eight</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='color:windowtext'>W</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>hen we reached the parking lot,
several more Army thugs were waiting, grown-ups now, khaki shirts and dense
mustaches, the regulation G-2 sunglasses even though it was still dark, with
9mm automatics in holsters at their belt. I took one look at them and I think I
blacked out. Steve and I were about to &quot;disappear,&quot; and possibly
Sarah too. Probably in another hour or two. My tattered mind finally just
slipped away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Soon afterward, I sensed myself being transported in a large
vehicle, and after that I was being carried, up, up, as though I were floating
into the coming dawn. When I re­gained consciousness, I realized I was standing
in a rain­storm near a small stone building. A dozen Army men were huddled
inside, shielding their cigarettes from the blowing rain while they guarded a
row of olive-green bassinets. Around me, censers were spewing <i>copal</i>
smoke into the soggy air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I became aware of the cooling sensation of the fresh rain
across my face, and wondered if it might clear some of the toad venom (surely
that was what it was) from my brain. Maybe it was working. Instead of seeing
vivid colors every­where, I was abruptly experiencing a hyper acute clarity of
every sensation. The stones beneath my bare feet were be­coming so articulated,
I felt as though I could number every granule, every crystal, every atom. The
paintings and carvings on the lintel above the door to the stone room—I rec­ognized
it as where I'd spent the first night—sparkled, leapt out at me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stand there on the edge of the platform,&quot; Alex
Goddard commanded, urging me forward. It was only then I realized we'd come up
the back steps of the pyramid, where the G-2 men had parked their black Land
Rovers, unnoticed and ready.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Looking down at the crowd of people gathered in the square, I
realized they couldn't really see much of what was going on atop the pyramid.
To them it was just a cloud of <i>copal</i> smoke and foggy rain. Although the
sun was starting to brighten the east, the only real light still came from the
torches stationed around the plaza.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then like a ghost materializing out of the mist, Marcelina
moved up the steep front steps, leading a line of Maya moth­ers from the
clinic—I counted twelve—each carrying her newborn, the &quot;special&quot; baby
she would give back to Kukulkan, perhaps the way Abraham of the Old Testament
offered up his son Isaac in sacrifice to Jehovah. It was a sight I shall never
forget, the sadness but also the unmistakable reverence in their eyes. I wanted
to yell at them to run, to take Sarah's votive babies and disappear into the
forest, but I didn't have the words.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next the women arrayed themselves in a line across the front
of the pyramid, facing not the crowd below, but toward Alex Goddard and me.
Then, holding out a jade-handled ob­sidian knife, he walked down the line,
allowing each woman to touch her forehead against its flint blade. I assumed
each one believed it was the instrument that would take her child's life,
ceremonially sending it back to the Maya Otherworld whence it came. Had he
drugged them too, I fleetingly won­dered, hypnotized them or given them some
potion to prevent them from comprehending what was really going on?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I kept remembering . . . a hundred other insane episodes of
immortal yearning leading to a mass &quot;transport&quot; to some other
&quot;plane.&quot; This, I thought, must be what it was like in the jungles of
Jonestown that death-filled morning. And Alex Goddard was their &quot;Jim
Jones,&quot; the spiritual leader of the moral travesty he'd imposed upon the
lost village of Baalum.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was going to stop it, somehow. By God, I was. I stared at
the women and felt so sad at the sight of the hand-woven blankets they held
their babies in, primary greens and reds and blues lovingly woven into
shimmering patterns that mir­rored the symbols across the sides of the stone
room. Their faces, especially their eyes, were transcendent in a kind of
chiaroscuro of darkest blacks and purest whites, as though all their humanity
had been caught by their blankets and shawls, surely created for this ultimate
moment. And the mother of Tz'ac Tzotz was there, carrying him, the baby I'd so
wanted to hold one last time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next Alex Goddard emerged from the stone room bearing a
basket filled with sheets of white bark-paper. He ap­proached Tz'ac Tzotz's
mother, then took a wide section of the paper and secured it around her face
with a silk cord, covering her vision. Down the line, one after another, he
carefully blindfolded the women, while they stood passively, some crying—from
joy or sorrow, I could not tell. Finally, at the last, he also covered
Marcelina's face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So she's not supposed to know what's really happening.
Nobody's supposed to know except him, and me. And, of course, Ramos and the G-2
secret police and whoever else is in on this crime. But, secretly, she does
know. The God of the House of Darkness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When he finished, he put down the basket, then turned to me.
&quot;Stand at the front edge of the platform and lift your hands in
benediction. They all want to see you, the new bride.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I took a couple of steps, then looked back to see him adding
more <i>copal</i> to the main censer, sending a fresh cloud of smoke billowing
out into the rain. As the incense poured around us, the Army thugs who'd been
loitering at the back of the stone room began coming forward, each carrying one
of the bassinets. They set them down on the stones, ready to start taking the
children. My outraged mind flashed on Ghirlandajo's &quot;Massacre of the
Innocents.&quot; Here, though, Sarah's children weren't being stabbed to death;
they were being—kidnapped and stolen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Revulsion pierced through me as though I'd been hit by a
jagged shaft of lightning, but instead of being knocked down, I was energized.
Or maybe the final effects of the toad venom were giving me a spurt of
adrenaline. Letting his criminal charade continue one second longer became
unbear­able. What would happen to me, I didn't know, but I couldn't let it go
on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No,&quot; I yelled, startling myself by the sound of my
own voice. &quot;In God's name, stop.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The rain was growing more intense, and I was soaked and
bleary-eyed, but before I could think I found myself stalking over to Tz'ac
Tzotz's mother, shouting at her. The next thing I knew I was ripping the paper
from her frightened eyes. I hugged her as best I could, then yelled back at
Marcelina.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell them all to take off their blindfolds. This is
obscene.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I went on autopilot, shutting out everything around
me—the rain, the perilous sides of the pyramid, the pistol-carrying G-2 thugs,
even Alex Goddard. The way I remember it now, it all took place in slow motion,
like some underwater dream sequence, but surely it was just the opposite.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Anyway, I do know I snapped. I started shouting again, and
with the G-2 hoods momentarily frozen, I started fling­ing the still-empty
bassinets down the steep side of the pyra­mid, where they just bounced away
into the rain. As I watched them disappearing, one after another, I felt
marvelously em­boldened. I would throw one and watch it go flying, and then I
would throw another. Yes, damn it, yes!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I wanted to show anybody with two eyes that it was all a
sham. Once they realized what was really happening, surely they would rise up
and drive Alex Goddard from their home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For a moment it seemed to be working. A stunned silence was
slowly spreading over the square, while everybody around me was paralyzed, like
waxworks. Maybe it's the same way you're temporarily caught off guard when a
stranger on the street goes berserk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By the time I'd flung away the last bassinet, the women had
all removed their blindfolds and were staring at me, dumbfounded. Finally, Tz'ac
Tzotz's mother whispered something to Marcelina, and she turned to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She wants to know why you're angry. You're the bride.
They only want to please you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Angry? I was terrified, but also fighting mad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Marcelina, this is all a ghastly lie.&quot; I'd finished
throwing and I was moving to the next stage. Get control. Could he risk killing
me in front of all these people? &quot;Tell them to take their babies and hide
in the forest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when I heard a cry that pierced through the rain and
across the square beyond, and I turned back to see Alex Goddard shoving toward
me. He's coming to murder me, since I've exposed him. But I wouldn't let it
happen without a fight. I clenched my fists, waiting, feeling my adrenaline
surge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Instead, though, he just brushed past me, headed toward the
edge of the platform. At first I didn't know why, but he was intent on
something off in the mist, his open hands thrust up at the rainy skies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when I heard the Guatemalan Army hoods yell­ing
curses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Vete ala chingada!</i>&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>They also were staring off to the south, in the same
di­rection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hadn't they noticed I'd just dismantled their sick pageant? I
wanted a reaction that would drive home the truth to Mar­celina, to the
mothers, to everyone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Damn it, look at me,&quot; I yelled, first at him and
then at the G-2 thugs. &quot;<i>Mira!</i>&quot; But their focus still was on
some­thing beyond the square.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally I turned, following their gaze, and for a second I
too forgot all about everything else. An intense red glow was illuminating the
morning sky from the direction of the clinic, a vibrant electric rose weaving
its hues in the mist. Then I saw spewing spikes of flame, orange and yellow,
dancing over the top of the clinic. There was a finality about it that
momentarily took my breath away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then it hit me. Steve's in there. It was a horror that, in my
initial shock, I couldn't actually process, the thought just hovering in the
recesses of my brain defying me to accept it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Alex Goddard turned back, shouting at the Army men in
rapid Spanish—I recognized the word for fire—that galvanized them to action.
They snapped out of their mental paralysis and headed down the pyramid, toward
two Land Rovers parked at the back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next he turned around and fixed his gaze on me. At last he
knew / knew he was capable of unspeakable evil, and I knew he knew I would do
everything in my power to stop him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All my records.&quot; His voice sounded as though it
was coming from another world, and it held a sadness that touched even me.
&quot;You have no idea what's been lost.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was distraught, but also obsessed. With his wild mane of
hair, he did, finally, look like Shiva the Destroyer. He stalked over and
seized the obsidian knife, then turned to­ward me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I looked for something to defend myself with. The bassi­nets,
which I might have used as a shield were gone. I only had my bare hands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I had to get away from him, get down the pyramid and find
Sarah and Steve. But as I started toward the front steps, the women were all
clustered there, blocking my way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then, for no reason I could understand the mother of Tz'ac
Tzotz stepped out of the group and handed me her baby, saying something in
Kekchi Maya and reaching to touch my cheek.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was so startled I took the bundle that was Sarah's child.
But then I thought, No! Alex Goddard will just kill him too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She said he must not harm you,&quot; Marcelina
whispered moving beside me. &quot;You are the special one. She wants you to
give her child back to Kukulkan.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She still believes, I realized. They all do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Holding Tz'ac Tzotz, my eyes fixed on Alex Goddard, I’d
entirely failed to notice a new presence on the pyramid a ghostlike waif in a
white shift who now stood silently in the doorway of the stone room. Sarah!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Marcelina had said she'd wanted to come for the cere­mony.
She was being helped to stand by the two Maya women who'd fed me the <i>atole</i>.
Somehow, she'd gotten them to bring her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Morgy, are you there?&quot; Sarah asked gazing
up at the rainy skies, the downpour soaking her blond hair, her eyes
unblinking. At that moment, I felt we'd joined become one person—me the dogged
rational half who'd just gone over the line, her the spiritual part that needed
to float, to fly free. &quot;I wanted to be with—&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sar, get back,&quot; I yelled and started to go to her,
but there wasn't time. Now Alex Goddard was moving toward me holding the knife,
as though tracking a prey, oblivious to Sarah, to everything. He'd concentrated
all his hatred on me and me alone, and I hated him back as much. Death hovered
between us, waiting to see whom to take.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But then the woman who had borne Tz'ac Tzotz said something
in Kekchi Maya, pointing back at me and her child, and lunged at him. They
collided together in the rain and next she slid down, first seizing his leg,
then losing her grip and slipping onto the stones, her long black hair askew in
the hovering smoke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She's trying to save me, I realized. Why—?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I saw Sarah pull away from the women supporting her and
slowly move across the platform.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgy . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was walking in the direction of Alex Goddard, but then
she stumbled over the fallen woman's leg and her hand went down as she sprawled
across her. She must have touched something, because she recoiled backward, and
only then did I notice the flare of a torch glinting off the obsidian knife now
protruding from the woman's chest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sarah rose up, her eyes full of anger, and awkwardly flung
her arms, searching. I could feel the passion that had been pent up all those
months she lay in the coma, feeding her madness. She managed to catch hold of
Alex Goddard's arm, and they began an awkward minuet, neither realizing how
close they were to the stone platform's edge. I stood mes­merized a moment,
then dashed toward them, but only in time to watch them vanish into the rain
and haze. It was as though there had been some sleight of hand. One second they
were there and the next they weren't. At first I thought my eyes were playing
tricks on me, but then I realized it was real. They were gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Sarah!</i>&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I reached the side in time to see them land on the first tier
of stones below. She'd fallen near the edge, but she was solid and safe. Alex
Goddard, however, hit with one foot on and one foot off, and the result was he
slid away, then van­ished into the dark rain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It's her final act of self-destruction. She's joined me in my
rage, but we've both been spared. That's the miracle of <i>Baalum</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Sar, don't move.&quot; I finally found my
voice. I was still holding Tz'ac Tzotz, who'd begun to shriek, his blue eyes
flooded with fear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now several village men from the square were running,
shouting, up the slippery steps. Their faces looked like they'd been painted at
one time, but now the rain had washed most of it away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While I yelled down to Sarah, again begging her not to move,
Marcelina was asking them something, and their an­swers were tumbling out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally I turned to look at her, the screaming Tz'ac Tzotz
still in my arms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No one knows where he is,&quot; she was saying as she
looked down over the side. &quot;He's gone into the forest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good.&quot; I pulled Tz'ac Tzotz to me and kissed him,
trying to tell him to calm down. It wasn't working.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Marcelina, here, please hold him. I've got to get down
to Sarah.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She took him. Then I walked over to where his mother lay
bleeding on the stones. The woman wasn't moving, the obsidian knife still
protruding from her chest. She'd saved me, but now death had taken her. There
was nothing anyone could do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was trembling, but I turned and began easing myself over
the side of the stone platform and onto the first tier of the pyramid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sar, don't move.&quot; I inched my way across to her.
&quot;Just</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>stay
still.&quot; The rain was pouring again, but the electric bloom of sparks and
flames from the direction of the clinic was unabated. It would be completely
gutted. Was Steve awake enough to get out? He'd seemed alert when I left him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgy, is that you?&quot; She was holding out her
fingers. &quot;I can't see you. Where are—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm here, Sar. Right here.&quot; I reached down and
took her hand, which was deathly cold. &quot;Come on. Let me help you get
up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Carefully, leaning against the wet stones of the side of the
pyramid, I gradually pulled her to her feet and away from the treacherous edge.
Then it hit me what she'd said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sar, what do you mean, you can't see me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm okay. It's just . . .&quot; She was gripping my
hand now, and then she brushed against the stone side of the pyramid and put out
her other hand to cling to it. &quot;Morgy, I took it again. To go to their
sacred place. But sometimes you can only see visions and then after a while
everything goes blank.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That bastard. Alex Goddard had given her the drug again. Now
she was lost in a world of colored lights, a place I'd just traveled through
myself. She probably had no idea she'd just pushed him off the pyramid and into
the dark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your hand feels so soft,&quot; she was saying.
&quot;You're like warm honey.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sar, try to walk. We're going to turn a corner and then
we'll be at the back of the pyramid. Next we'll come to some steps, and then
we're going down.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I inched our way along, scarcely able to keep our foot­ing
because of the rain, I wondered again about Steve. Please, God, let him be all
right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When we finally got to the steps, Marcelina was there,
standing expectantly, holding Tz'ac Tzotz. He was still cry­ing, intermittent
sobs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He belongs to you now,&quot; she said, holding him out
for me. &quot;It's what she wished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What—?&quot; I took him before I realized what I was
doing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I cradled him, gazing down at his tender little face, I
realized he truly was Sarah all over again. And I was so glad she couldn't see
him. Never, I thought, she must never, ever know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I finally forced myself to place him back into Marcelina's
arms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You've got no idea how much I want him, but I can't.
Let one of these women give him her milk, have a twin for her own child.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For that wrenching moment I'd held the very baby my heart
longed for. But he was the last one on earth I could have. Just go, take Sarah
and find Steve and go as far from <i>Baalum</i> as you can, before you lose
your compass and do something terribly selfish.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Marcelina,&quot; I said, reaching to hug her,
&quot;tell them these 'sacred' children are all from his <i>medico</i>. Look up
'in vitro' in your dictionary. That's all it is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She hugged me back, though I wasn't sure whether she
understood. Then I asked her to take Sarah's hand for a mo­ment while I went
back up the steps to the platform. I felt a primal anger as I took one last
look at the women Alex Goddard had wronged, now clustered around the body of
Tz'ac Tzotz's mother. Then I bade them a silent farewell, turned, and walked,
holding my tears, back through the stone room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The rear of the pyramid was deserted, the steps slippery and
dangerous, but it was our way out. I began leading Sarah down, step by
treacherous step. Everything had happened so fast I'd barely had time to think
about Steve. Those flames, my God. It was finally sinking in, truly hitting me.
Had he gotten out in time?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the slimy Rio Tigre, now swelling from the rain, came
into view. I stared at it a second before I noticed the three young Army
recruits leaning against the trunk of a giant Cebia tree next to the trail,
their rifles covered in plastic against the rain. When they saw us, they
stiffened, shifted their weapons, and glanced up at the top of the pyramid, as
though seeking orders. Neither group had any idea why the other was there.
Sarah and I were an unforeseen contingency they hadn't been briefed on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What are they going to do? They have no idea what just
happened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgy,&quot; Sarah said, gazing blankly at the sky,
&quot;the colors are so beautiful. Can we—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shhh, we'll talk in a minute.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I smiled and nodded and began walking past the young
privates, holding my breath. Then a spectral form emerged out of the rain just
behind them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It took me a moment to recognize who it was. I was hoping it
might be Steve, but instead it was a man dressed in white, now covered with
mud, and holding a knife, not obsidian this time but long and steel. His eyes
were glazed, and I wasn't sure if he even knew exactly where he was. Why had he
come down to the river? Had he known I'd come here, too?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For a moment we just stood staring at each other, while the
Army privates began edging up the hill, as though not wanting to witness what
surely was coming next.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why don't you put an end to all the evil?&quot; I
yelled at him finally, trying to project through the rain. &quot;Just stop it
right now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Baalum</i> was my life's work,&quot; he said. Then
he looked down at the knife a moment, as though unsure what it was. Finally he
turned and flung it in the direction of the river.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It could have been beautiful,&quot; I said back. Thank
God the knife was gone. But what would he do next? &quot;But now—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No,&quot; he said staring directly at me, his eyes
seeming to plead. &quot;It is. It will be again. To make a place like <i>Baalum
</i>is to coin the riches of God. I want you to stay. To be part of it.
Together, we . . .&quot; But whatever else he said was lost in the cloudburst
that abruptly swept over the embankment. In an instant it was a torrent, the
last outpouring of the storm, powerful and unrelenting. Nature had unleashed
its worst, as though Kukulkan was rendering his final judgment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Morgy, I'm falling,&quot; Sarah screamed. The ground she
and I had been standing on began turning to liquid as though it were a custard
melting in the tropical heat. As we began slipping down the embankment toward
him, I gripped her arm with my left hand and reached up to seize a low-lying
branch of the Cebia with my right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then, under the weight of the water, all the soil beneath us
gave way, tons of wet riverbank that abruptly buckled outward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alex Goddard made no sound as the mass of earth lifted him
backward toward the river. His sullied garb of white blended into the gray
sludge of mud and rain, then faded to darkness as the embankment dissolved into
the swirling Rio Tigre.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sar, hold on. Please hold on.&quot; I felt my grasp of
the tree slipping, but now the mud slide had begun to stabilize.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I managed to cling to the limb for a few seconds more, the
bark cutting into my fingers, and then my hold slipped away, sending us both
spiraling downward till we were tem­porarily snagged by the Cebia's newly
exposed undergrowth. I still had her hand though just barely, but the torrent
of rain and mud was subsiding, and finally we collapsed together into the
gnarled network of roots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After a moment's rest, I managed to crawl out and pull her
up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come on, Sar. Try and walk.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Together we stumbled and slid down the last incline before
the river's edge, then turned upstream along the bank. After about fifty yards,
sure enough, the native <i>cayucos</i>, the hollowed-out mahogany canoes I'd
told Steve about, were still there just as I'd seen them that first morning,
bobbing and straining at their moorings. In the rain I couldn't tell how usable
they were, but I figured going downriver was the only way we'd ever be able to
get out. We'd have to flee the way Sarah had that first time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For a moment I thought they all were empty—dear God, no—but
then I realized there was a drenched figure in the last one in the row. When I
recognized who it was, I think I completely lost it; all the horror of the last
two days swal­lowed me up. I grabbed Sarah and hugged her for dear life,
feeling the tears coursing down my cheeks. I literally couldn't help myself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They were tied up here just like you said.&quot; Steve
wiped the rain from his eyes, then reached to take my hand. His bandaged nose
was bleeding again, and he looked like he'd just been half killed. &quot;I told
those little Army <i>chicos</i> I was a big amigo of <i>el doctor </i>and they
saluted and showed me where these were tied up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thank God you're okay. What happened? Did—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ramos, the son of a bitch. He came in and ... I guess
it was time to finish me off. But I wasn't as drugged out as he thought.&quot;
He was staring at Sarah, clearly relieved but asking no questions. &quot;I
brought along his nine-millime­ter&quot;—he indicated the silver automatic in
his belt—&quot;in case we run into problems.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I wanted to kiss him, but I was still too shaken up. Instead
I focused on helping Sarah in without capsizing everything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>After I'd
settled her, I pulled myself over the side and reached for a paddle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If we go with the current,&quot; I said, &quot;we'll
get to the Usumacinta. Hopefully the flooding will help push us down­stream.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Honestly, I didn't think the fire would get away from
me like it did.&quot; He shoved off amidst the swirling debris. &quot;Jesus. I
heard them taking you away, and I assumed you didn't get to mess up his lab. So
I figured there was one way . . . I just threw around some ether and pitched a
match. The place was empty, so . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I looked around at the roiling waters, snakes and croco­diles
lurking, and felt a lifetime of determination. Was Alex Goddard still alive? I
no longer cared. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sunrise was breaking through the last of the rain, laying
dancing shadows on the water as we rowed for midstream. Someday, I knew, what
was real about <i>Baalum </i>and what I'd dreamed here might well merge
together, the way they had for Sarah. But for now, true daylight never looked
better.</span></p>

<h2><a name=bookmark31>Chapter Twenty-nine</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

got picked up by a ragged crew of Mexican fishermen just before dark. Aside
from being sunburned to medium rare, we were physically okay. The fresh air and
sunshine did a lot to bring Sarah back, though she did have lapses of
non-rationality, and once tried to dive over the side of their fishing cutter.
They dropped us off at the tourist site of Yaxchitan, a Mayan ruin on the
western bank of the mighty Usumacinta, where we joined an American day-tour on
its way back to San Cristobal de las Casas. There we caught a prop flight to
Cancun, and then American Airlines to New York. We had no luggage, but I flew
us first-class, and I still have the MasterCard slip to prove it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As things turned out, though, returning Sarah to nor­malcy—or
me, for that matter—was another struggle en­tirely. For me, time, after that
rainy morning in the Peten, became an essence that flowed around me as though I
were aswim in the ether of interstellar space, pondering the con­junction of
good and evil. I suffered flashbacks, late-night reveries of forests and
children that must have been like those Sarah struggled to bury. For weeks
after that, I had a lot of trouble remembering meetings, returning phone calls,
giving David an honest day's editing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For her own part, Sarah just seemed to drift at first, to the
point I sometimes wondered if she realized she was back at Lou's loft. Then
abruptly, one day she snapped into her old self and started sending for
re-registration materials from Co­lumbia. I really needed to talk with her
about our mutual nightmare, but she seemed to have erased all memories of <i>Baalum</i>,
except for occasional mumbles in Kekchi Maya. Perhaps that was best, I consoled
myself. Maybe it was wise for us all just to let the ghosts of that faraway
place lie sleep­ing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As for Lou, I told him as little as I could about what
happened to her there. He hadn't returned to work, had mainly stayed at his
Soho place to be near her, as though he was fearful she might be snatched away
from him once more. Frankly, I think all his enforced closeness was starting to
grate on her nerves, though I dared not hint such a thing to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the meantime, Steve returned to Belize to wrap up his
photo essay, and David submitted a (very) rough cut of <i>Baby Love </i>to the
selection committee at Sundance (our hoped-for distribution deal with Orion
was, alas, in temporary turn­around pending yet another management shuffle). We
did, however, squeeze an advance from Lifetime that lowered the heat with Nicky
Russo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nevertheless, the story of how Alex Goddard touched all our
lives still wasn't over. It was two months after we got back to the city that
my dark dance with the man who thought he was Shiva, creator and destroyer, had
its final pirouette, as though his ghost had returned from his rain-forest
redoubt for one last sorcerer's turn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Truthfully, it all transpired so fast I could scarcely take
it in, but here's the rough outline of what happened. I was work­ing late that
Thursday evening in the editing room at Applecore, around seven o'clock. And I
was feeling particularly out of sorts, including a headache and stomach pains
from the leftover pizza I'd microwaved to keep me going. I was re-cutting some
new real-life interviews I'd filmed to replace those of Carly and Paula.
(Children of Light had gone de­funct, by the way, the phone at Quetzal Manor
disconnected, but I didn't need any more excitement in my life of the colo­nel
Ramos variety. The replacement interviews weren't nearly as bubbly and full of
exuberance, but they were actually much truer to the realities of adoption.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Anyway, I listened to my stomach, and decided it was high
time to toss in the towel. I got my things, locked up, and then I ran into
David on the elevator, coming down from the floor above.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How's it going?&quot; he asked, ostentatiously checking
his watch, an approving gleam in his eyes. I was glad he wanted to let me know
he'd noticed I was logging long hours. Then he looked at me again. &quot;Hey,
you feeling okay?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've been better,&quot; I said, thinking how nice it
was that he cared. &quot;Could be a couple of aspirin and a good night's sleep
are called for.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So now you're a doctor?&quot; he said, following me
into the lobby, &quot;Providing self-diagnosis—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;David, give me a break. I just happen to feel a little
off today, okay? It doesn't mean I'm at death's door.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah, well, the way you look you coulda fooled
me.&quot; He headed down the street, toward the avenue. Then he called back
over his shoulder. &quot;I don't want to see you in tomorrow unless you look
like you might live through the day. I pay for your health insurance. Use it,
for God's sake.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After I found a cab, I began to think he might be right. This
was no typical down day. So I decided I'd stop at the Duane Reade on my corner
and talk to the pharmacist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The second-shift man was on, a gray-haired portly old guy who
knew more about drugs than most doctors. The tag on his jacket said
&quot;Bernd&quot; and that's all anybody ever knew of his name. I sometimes
called him &quot;Dr. Bernd&quot; by way of banter, but nothing I could do would
ever make him smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The place was nearly empty and the pharmacy at the rear, with
its spectral fluorescent lighting, looked like an out-take from a low-budget
Wes Craven movie. Bernd, who was in back puttering, came out and looked me
over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I know it sounds naive, but I trusted him more than I trust
half the young, overworked interns you get at an emergency room these days. I
poured out my symptoms, including the story about how I'd been given fertility
drugs and toad venom. Was it all coming back to haunt me, the dark hand of Alex
Goddard?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He began by asking me some very perceptive questions, about
things that had been puzzling me but I'd sort of man­aged to dismiss. Finally,
he walked around the counter and lifted a small, shrink-wrapped box off a rack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Try this,&quot; he said handing it over, &quot;and then
come back tomorrow. Maybe it's not such a big deal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>You're kidding, I thought, looking at the box.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I got home, collapsed onto the couch, and opened it. Be­lieve
it or not, I actually had to read the instructions. I did what they said,
checked the time, and then decided to run a hot bath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I filled the tub, dumped in some bubble-bath, put the cord­less
on the toilet seat, and splashed in. It felt so good I wanted to dissolve. Then
I reached for the phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The clock above the sink read eight-thirty, and I figured
rightly, that Steve would be back at his hotel in Belize City. Sure enough I
got him on the first try.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Honey, you sitting down?&quot; I said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm lying down. You wouldn't believe my day.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You 're not going to believe what I just heard from the
pharmacist at the corner. Remember I told you I've been feeling strange, and
some things were a little behind sched­ule? Well, guess what. We're about to
find out something. We can't be together, but we can share it over a
satellite.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm doing the test right now. You know, you take the
stick out of the glass holder and if it's turned pink. . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was speechless for a long moment. Finally he just said,
&quot;Wow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I checked the clock again, then reached for the test tube.
This, I realized, is the most incredible moment in any woman's life. Is your
world going to go on being the same, or is it never, ever going to be the same
again?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I pulled out the stick, it was a bright, beautiful pink.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Steve. I love you. It's—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Max.&quot; He didn't realize it, but his voice had just
gone up an octave.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's my dad's middle name. I want to name him Max.
It's an old family tradition.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what if it's a girl? Don't say Maxine or I'll
divorce you before you even make an honest woman of me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nope. If it's a girl, then you get to pick.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I couldn't believe I was finally having this conversation. It
was something I'd dreamed of for years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It then got too maudlin to repeat. He was coming home in
eleven days, and we planned the celebration. Dinner at Le Cirque and then an
evening at Cafe Carlyle. For a cou­ple of would-be New York sophisticates, that
was about as fancy-schmancy as this town gets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was crying tears of triumph by the time we hung up. By then
it was late enough I figured Arlene would be home from her exercise class, so I
decided to call her and break the happy news once more. Who I really wanted to
call was Betsy, on the Coast, but I knew she'd still be driving home from her
temp job. Arlene would have to do. Telling her would be the equivalent of
sending an urgent E-mail to the entire office, but I wanted everybody to know.
Two birds with one stone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I looked down at my body, all the curves and soft skin, and
tried to think about the miracle of a baby finally growing inside it, life
recreating itself. God!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arlene was going to break my mood, but for some reason I had
to call her. If only to bring me back to reality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I reached over and clicked open the cordless again. I was
punching in her number when something made me pause. It was a nagging thought
that I'd managed to repress for a while. Finally, though, it wouldn't stay down
any more. There was something I had to check out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I slowly put down the handset, climbed out of the tub, dried
off, then plodded into the bedroom to dig out my pri­vate calendar, which had
long since become a record of ev­erything relevant to my and Steve's baby
project.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was buried at the bottom of the desk's second drawer, in
amongst old bank statements. It was also, figuratively, covered by two months
of dust, since that was how long it'd been since I'd bothered with it. I guess
my attitude had been, what's the point?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I placed it on the desk, trying not to get it wet. Then I
wrapped the towel more firmly around me, switched on the desk lamp, and sat
down. I think I was also holding my breath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I counted all the days twice, but there was no mistaking. The
night Steve and I had spent so gloriously together in the Camino Real wasn't a
fertile time. Not even close. I suppose that by then I'd become so despairing
of ever getting preg­nant, I hadn't even given it any thought. It was enough
just to see him and hold him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I just sat there for a long time staring at the white page,
unable to move, random thoughts coming too fast to contain inside my tangled
brain. Finally, though, I managed to get up</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>and numbly
put the calendar away. Order, I needed order. I then worked my way into the
kitchen to fix myself something. I had a glass of water, then pulled down a
bottle of Red Label and poured myself half a tumbler. Okay, somewhere down deep
I knew it was the worst possible thing I could do, but I wasn't thinking, just
going on autopilot and dismay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I drank off a shot of the foul-tasting scotch, then realized
how thoughtless that was and dumped the rest into the sink. Next, I moved into
the living room and put on a raga, &quot;Malkauns,&quot; concert volume, the
one where the first note goes straight to your heart. Finally I collapsed onto
the couch, the room now gloriously alive with all the spirituality and sensu­ality
of the raga, notes piling on exquisite notes. For a while I just lay there
numbly, enveloped in its lush eroticism. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Eventually I started to think. Alex Goddard had planned to
take from me, but had he also given? Had his &quot;proprie­tary&quot; ovulation
drugs . . . causing all those hundreds of eggs to mature simultaneously . . .
inadvertently let me get preg­nant?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I had a dismaying counter-thought. Could he have done an
<i>in vitro</i> while I was under sedation, when he har­vested my ova? The
ultimate link to <i>Baalum</i>. Was my baby Sarah's too? One of those last
frozen embryos in his . . .?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I leaned back and closed my eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No, surely not. This baby was Steve's and mine. Ours. Had to
be. His unintended, beautiful, ironic gift.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Surely . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Uh-uh. Go for a second take. Embrace life. Be Molly Bloom and
shout it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes!</span></p>
